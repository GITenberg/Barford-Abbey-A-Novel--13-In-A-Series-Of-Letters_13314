    <h2>LETTER I.</h2>
    <p>Lady MARY SUTTON, at the German Spaw, to Miss WARLEY, in England.</p>
    <br />

    <p>How distressing, how heart-rending, is my dear Fanny's mournful detail!&mdash;It
    lies before me; I weep over it!&mdash;I weep not for the departed saint: no; it is
    for you, myself, for all who have experienced her god-like virtues!&mdash;Was she not
    an honour to her sex? Did she not merit rewards too great for this world to
    bestow?&mdash;Could the world repay her innocence, her piety, her resignation? Wipe
    away, my best love, the mark of sorrow from your cheek. Perhaps she may be permitted
    to look down: if so, will she smile on those that grieve at her entering into the
    fullness of joy?&mdash;Here a sudden death cannot be called dreadful. A life like
    hers wanted not the admonitions of a sick-bed;&mdash;her bosom accounts always clear,
    always ready for inspection, day by day were they held up to the throne of
    mercy.&mdash;Apply those beautiful lines in the Spectator to her; lines you have so
    often admir'd.&mdash;How silent thy passage; how private thy journey; how glorious
    thy end! Many have I known more famous, some more knowing, not one so
    innocent.&mdash;Hope is a noble support to the drooping head of sorrow.&mdash;Though
    a deceiver, court her, I counsel you;&mdash;she leads to happiness;&mdash;we shall
    bless her deceptions:&mdash;baffling our enjoyments here, she teaches us to look up
    where every thing is permanent, even bliss most exquisite.</p>
    <p>Mr. Whitmore you never knew, otherwise would have wonder'd how his amiable wife
    loiter'd so long behind.&mdash;Often she has wish'd to be reunited to him, but ever
    avoided the subject in your presence.</p>
    <p>Keep not from me her rich bequest:&mdash;<i>rich</i> indeed,&mdash;her most
    valuable treasure.&mdash;That I could fold you to my arms!&mdash;But hear me at a
    distance;&mdash;hear me call you my beloved daughter,&mdash;and suppose what my
    transports will be when I embrace an only child:&mdash;yes, you are mine, till I
    deliver you up to a superior affection.</p>
    <p>Lay aside, I conjure you, your fears of crossing the sea.&mdash;Mr. and Mrs. Smith
    intend spending part of this winter at Montpelier: trust yourself with them; I shall
    be there to receive you at the H&ocirc;tel de Spence.</p>
    <p>The season for the Spaw is almost at an end. My physicians forbid my return to
    England till next autumn, else I would fly to comfort,&mdash;to console my dearest
    Fanny,&mdash;We shall be happy together in France:&mdash;I can love you the same in
    all places.</p>
    <p>My banker has orders to remit you three hundred pounds;&mdash;but your power is
    unlimited; it is impossible to say, my dear, how much I am in your debt.&mdash;I have
    wrote my housekeeper to get every thing ready for your reception:&mdash;consider her,
    and all my other servants, as your own.&mdash;I shall be much disappointed if you do
    not move to the Lodge immediately.&mdash;You shall not,&mdash;must
    not,&mdash;continue in a house where every thing in and about it reminds you of so
    great a loss.&mdash;Miss West, Miss Gardner, Miss Conway, will, at my request,
    accompany you thither.&mdash;The Menagerie,&mdash;plantations, and other places of
    amusement, will naturally draw them out;&mdash;you will follow mechanically, and by
    that means be kept from indulging melancholy.&mdash;Go an-airing every day, unless
    you intend I shall find my horses unfit for service:&mdash;why have you let them live
    so long idle?</p>
    <p>I revere honest Jenkings&mdash;he is faithful,&mdash;he will assist you with his
    advice on all occasions.&mdash;Can there be a better resource to fly to, than a heart
    governed by principles of honour and humanity?</p>
    <p>Write, my dear, to Mrs. Smith, and let me know if the time is fixed for their
    coming over.&mdash;Say you will comply with the request my heart is so much set
    on;&mdash;say you will be one of the party.</p>
    <p>My health and spirits are better:&mdash;the latter I support for your
    sake;&mdash;who else do I live for?&mdash;Endeavour to do the same, not only for me,
    but <i>others</i>, that one day will be as dear to you as you are to</p>
    <p>Your truly affectionate,</p>
    <p>M. SUTTON.</p>

    <h2>LETTER II.</h2>
    <p>Miss WARLEY to Lady MARY SUTTON.</p>
    <p><i>Barford Abbey</i>.</p>
    <br />

    <p>BARFORD ABBEY! <i>Yes</i>, my dearest Lady,&mdash;I date from Barford Abbey: a
    house I little thought ever to have seen, when I have listened hours to a description
    of it from Mr. Jenkings.&mdash;What are houses,&mdash;what palaces, in competition
    with <i>that</i> honour, <i>that</i> satisfaction, I received by your Ladyship's last
    letter!&mdash;The honour all must acknowledge;&mdash;the satisfaction is not on the
    surface,&mdash;<i>it centers in the heart</i>.&mdash;I feel too much to express any
    thing.&mdash;One moment an orphan; next the adopted child of Lady Mary
    Sutton.&mdash;What are titles, except ennobled by virtue! <i>That</i> only makes a
    coronet fit graceful on the head;&mdash;<i>that</i> only is the true ornament of
    greatness.</p>
    <p>Pardon my disobedience.&mdash;Can there be a stronger command than your
    request?&mdash;But, my Lady, I must have died,&mdash;my life <i>must</i> have been
    the sacrifice, had I gone to the Lodge.&mdash;The windows opposite, the windows of
    that little mansion where I spent nineteen happy years with my angelic
    benefactress,&mdash;could it be borne?&mdash;Your Ladyship's absence too;&mdash;what
    an aggravation;&mdash;The young ladies you kindly propose for my companions, though
    very amiable, could not have shut my eyes, or deaden'd my other senses.</p>
    <p>Now let me account for being at Barford Abbey.&mdash;Was Mr. Jenkings my father, I
    think I could not love him more; yet when he press'd me to return with him to
    Hampshire, I was doubtful whether to consent, till your Ladyship's approbation of him
    was confirmed in so particular a manner.&mdash;His son an only one;&mdash;the fine
    fortune he must possess;&mdash;these were objections not only of <i>mine</i>, but, I
    believe, of my dear, dear&mdash;Oh! my Lady, I cannot yet write her name.&mdash;Often
    has she check'd Mr. Jenkings, when he has solicited to take me home with
    him:&mdash;her very looks spoke she had something to fear from such a
    visit.&mdash;She loved me;&mdash;the dear angel loved me with maternal affection, but
    her partiality never took place of noble, generous sentiments.&mdash;Young people,
    she has frequently said, are, by a strict intimacy, endeared to each other. This, I
    doubt not, was her motive for keeping me at a distance.&mdash;She well knew my poor
    expectations were ill suited to his large ones.&mdash;I know what was her opinion,
    and will steadily adhere to it.</p>
    <p>Edmund, to do him common justice, is a desirable youth:&mdash;such a one as I can
    admire his good qualities, without another with than to imitate them.&mdash;Monday,
    the tenth, I took my leave of Hillford Down, and, after a melancholy journey, arrived
    Tuesday evening at Mr. Jenkings's.&mdash;Nothing did I enjoy on the road;&mdash;in
    spight of my endeavours, tears stream'd from my eyes incessantly;&mdash;even the fine
    prospects that courted attention, pass'd unnotic'd.&mdash;My good conductor strove to
    draw me off from gloomy subjects, but in vain, till we came within a few miles of his
    house; then of a sudden I felt a serenity, which, for some time, has been a stranger
    to my breast;&mdash;a serenity I cannot account for.</p>
    <p><i>Mrs. Jenkings!</i>&mdash;never shall I forget her humanity. She flew to the
    chaise the instant it stopp'd, receiv'd me with open arms, and conducted me to the
    parlour, pouring out ten thousand welcomes, intermingled with fond
    embraces.&mdash;She is, I perceive, one of those worthy creatures, who make it a
    point to consider their husbands friends as their own; in my opinion, the highest
    mark of conjugal happiness.</p>
    <p>Plac'd in a great chair next the fire, every one was busied in something or other
    for my refreshment.&mdash;One soul,&mdash;one voice,&mdash;one manner, to be seen in
    the father,&mdash;mother,&mdash;son:&mdash;they look not on each other but with a
    smile of secret satisfaction. <i>To me</i> their hearts speak the same expressive
    language;&mdash;their house,&mdash;their dress,&mdash;their words, plainly
    elegant.&mdash;Envy never stops at such a dwelling;&mdash;nothing there is fit for
    her service:&mdash;no pomp,&mdash;no grandeur,&mdash;no ostentation.&mdash;I slept
    sweetly the whole night;&mdash;sweetly!&mdash;not one disagreeable idea intruded on
    my slumbers.</p>
    <p>Coming down in the morning, I found breakfast on the table, linen white as snow, a
    large fire,&mdash;every thing that speaks cleanliness, content, and plenty.&mdash;The
    first thing in a house which attracts my notice is the fire;&mdash;I conclude from
    that, if the hearts of the inhabitants are warm or cold.&mdash;Our conversation was
    interesting;&mdash;it might have lasted, for aught I know, till dinner, had it not
    been interrupted by the entrance of Sir James and Lady Powis.&mdash;I knew Mr.
    Jenkings was their steward, but never expected they came to his house with such easy
    freedom.&mdash;We arose as they entered:&mdash;I was surprised to see Mr. and Mrs.
    Jenkings appear confused;&mdash;in my opinion, their visitors accosted them more like
    <i>equals</i> than <i>dependants</i>.</p>
    <p>Your Ladyship cannot imagine how greatly I was prepossessed in their favour even
    before they spoke.&mdash;In their manner was something that struck me
    excessively;&mdash;few&mdash;very few&mdash;can express the nameless beauties of
    grace,&mdash;never to be seen but in a carriage sweetly humble.</p>
    <p>Lady Powis seated herself opposite to me.&mdash;We called, said she, addressing
    Mr. Jenkings, to inquire what was become of you, fearing your Oxfordshire friends had
    stolen you from us;&mdash;but you have made up for your long absence, if this is the
    young lady, bowing to me, your wife told us was to return with you.&mdash;A
    politeness so unexpected,&mdash;so deliver'd,&mdash;visibly affected me:&mdash;I sat
    silent, listening for the reply Mr. Jenkings would make.</p>
    <p>Pardon me, my Lady! pardon me, Miss Warley! said the good man,&mdash;I am a
    stranger to punctilio;&mdash;I see my error:&mdash;I should have acquainted your
    Ladyship before with the name of this dear young Lady; I should have said she is an
    honour to her friends.&mdash;Need I tell Miss Warley, Sir James and Lady Powis are
    present:&mdash;I hope the deportment of their <i>servant</i> has confirmed
    it;&mdash;I hope it has.</p>
    <p>Sir James kindly took his hand, and, turning to me, said, Don't believe him,
    Madam, he is not our servant;&mdash;he has been our <i>friend</i> forty years; we
    flatter ourselves he deems not <i>that</i> servitude.</p>
    <p>Not your <i>servant!</i>&mdash;not your <i>dependant!</i>&mdash;not your
    <i>servant</i>, Sir James!&mdash;and was running on when her Ladyship interrupted
    him.</p>
    <p>Don't make me angry, Jenkings;&mdash;don't pain me;&mdash;hear the favour I have
    to ask, and be my advocate:&mdash;it is with Miss Warley I want you to be my
    advocate.&mdash;Then addressing herself to me, Will you, Madam, give me the pleasure
    of your company often at the Abbey?&mdash;I mean, will you come there as if it was
    your home?&mdash;Mr. and Mrs. Jenkings have comforts, I have not,&mdash;at least that
    I can enjoy.&mdash;Here she sigh'd deeply;&mdash;so deep, that I declare it pierced
    through my heart;&mdash;I felt as if turn'd into stone;&mdash;what I suppose I was a
    true emblem of.&mdash;The silent friends that trickled down my cheeks brought me back
    from that inanimate state,&mdash;and I found myself in the embraces of Lady Powis,
    tenderly affectionate, as when in the arms of Mrs. Whitmore.&mdash;Judge not, Madam,
    said I, from my present stupidity, that I am so wanting in my head or heart, to be
    insensible of this undeserv'd goodness.&mdash;With Mr. and Mrs. Jenkings's
    permission, I am devoted to your Ladyship's service.&mdash;<i>Our</i> approbation!
    Miss Warley, return'd the former;&mdash;<i>yes, that</i> you have:&mdash;her Ladyship
    cannot conceive how happy she has made us.&mdash;Sir James seconded his Lady with a
    warmth perfectly condescending:&mdash;no excuse would be taken; I must spend the next
    day at the Abbey; their coach was to attend me.</p>
    <p>Our amiable guests did not move till summoned by the dinner-bell, which is plainly
    to be heard there.&mdash;I thought I should have shed tears to see them
    going.&mdash;I long'd to walk part of the way, but was afraid to propose it, lest I
    should appear presumptuous.&mdash;Her Ladyship perceiv'd my
    inclinations,&mdash;look'd delighted,&mdash;and requested my company; on which Mr.
    Jenkings offer'd his service to escort me back.</p>
    <p>How was I surpris'd at ascending the hill!&mdash;My feet seem'd leading me to the
    first garden&mdash;the sweet abode of innocence!&mdash;Ten thousand beauties broke on
    my sight;&mdash;ten thousand pleasures, before unknown, danced through my
    heart.&mdash;Behold me on the summit;&mdash;behold me full of surprise,&mdash;full of
    admiration!&mdash;How enchanting the park! how clear the river that winds through
    it!&mdash;What taste,&mdash;what elegance, in the plantations!&mdash;How charmingly
    are Nature's beauties rang'd by art!&mdash;The trees,&mdash;the shrubs,&mdash;the
    flowers,&mdash;hold up their heads, as if proud of the spot they grow on!&mdash;Then
    the noble old structure,&mdash;the magnificent mansion of this ancient family, how
    does it fire the beholder with veneration and delight! The very walls seem'd to
    speak; at least there was something that inform'd <i>me</i>, native dignity, and
    virtues hereditary, dwelt within them.</p>
    <p>The sight of a chaise and four, standing at the entrance, hurried me from the
    charming pair of this paradise, after many good days ecchoed to me, and thanks
    respectful return'd them by the same messenger.</p>
    <p>Mr. Jenkings, in our return, entertain'd me with an account of the family for a
    century past. A few foibles excepted in the character of Sir James, I find he
    possesses all the good qualities of his ancestors. Nothing could be more pleasing
    than the encomiums bestow'd on Lady Powis; but she is not exempt from trouble: the
    <i>good</i> and the <i>bad</i> the <i>great</i> and the <i>little</i>, at some time
    or other, feel Misfortune's touch. Happy such a rod hangs over us! Were we to glide
    on smoothly, our affections would be fixed here, and here only.</p>
    <p>I could love Lady Powis with a warmth not to be express'd;&mdash;but&mdash;forgive
    me, my dear lady&mdash;I pine to know why <i>your</i> intimacy was
    interrupted.&mdash;Of <i>Lady Mary's</i> steadiness and integrity I am
    convinc'd;&mdash;of <i>Lady Powis</i> I have had only a transitory view.&mdash;Heaven
    forbid she should be like such people as from my heart I despise, whose regards are
    agueish! Appearances promise the reverse;&mdash;but what is appearance? For the
    generality a mere cheat, a gaudy curtain.</p>
    <p>Pardon me, dear Lady Powis&mdash;I am distress'd,&mdash;I am perplex'd; but I do
    not think ill of you;&mdash;indeed I cannot,&mdash;unless I find&mdash;<i>No</i>, I
    cannot find it neither;&mdash;something tells me <i>Lady Mary</i>, my dear honour'd
    Lady Mary, will acquit you.</p>
    <p>We were receiv'd by Mrs. Jenkings, at our return, with a chearful countenance, and
    conducted to the dining-parlour, where, during our comfortable, meal, nothing was
    talk'd of but Sir James and Lady Powis:&mdash;the kind notice taken of your Fanny
    mentioned with transport.</p>
    <p>Thus honour'd,&mdash;thus belov'd,&mdash;dare I repine?&mdash;Why look on past
    enjoyments with such a wistful eye!&mdash;Mrs. Whitmore, my dear maternal Mrs.
    Whitmore, cannot be recall'd!&mdash;Strange perversenss!&mdash;why let that which
    would give me pleasure fleet away!&mdash;why pursue that which I cannot
    overtake!&mdash;No gratitude to heaven!&mdash;Gratitude to you, my dearest Lady,
    shall conquer this perverseness;&mdash;even now my heart overflows like a swoln
    river.</p>
    <p>Good night, good night, dear Madam; I am going to repose on the very bed where,
    for many years, rested the most deserving of men!&mdash;The housekeeper has been
    relating many of his virtues;&mdash;so many, that I long to see him, <i>though only
    in a dream</i>.</p>
    <p>Was it not before Mr. Powis went abroad, that your ladyship visited at the
    Abbey?&mdash;Yet, if so, I think I should have heard you mention him.&mdash;Merit
    like his could never pass unnotic'd in a breast so similar&mdash;Here I drop my pen,
    lest I grow impertinent.&mdash;Once again, good night,&mdash;my more than

    <h2>LETTER III.</h2>
    <p>Miss WARLEY to Lady MARY SUTTON, in continuation.</p>
    <p><i>Barford Abbey</i>.</p>
    <br />

    <p>I think I have told your Ladyship, I was to be honour'd with the coach to convey
    me to the Abbey.&mdash;About half an hour after one it arriv'd, when a card was
    deliver'd me from Lady Powis, to desire my friends would not be uneasy, if I did not
    return early in the evening, as she hop'd for an agreeable party at whist, Lord
    Darcey being at the Abbey.</p>
    <p>Mrs. Jenkings informed me, his Lordship was a ward of Sir James's just of
    age;&mdash;his estate genteel, not large;&mdash;his education liberal,&mdash;his
    person fine,&mdash;his temper remarkably good.&mdash;Sir James, said she, is for ever
    preaching lessons to him, that he must marry <i>prudently</i>;&mdash;which is, that
    he must never marry without an immense fortune.&mdash;Ah! Miss Warley, this same love
    of money has serv'd to make poor Lady Powis very unhappy. Sir James's greatest fault
    is covetousness;&mdash;but who is without fault?&mdash;Lord Darcey was a lovely
    youth, continued she, when he went abroad; I long to see if he is alter'd by
    travelling.&mdash;Edmund and his Lordship were school-fellows:&mdash;how my son will
    be overjoy'd to hear he is at the Abbey!&mdash;I detain you, Miss Warley, or could
    talk for ever of Lord Darcey! Do go, my dear, the family will expect
    you.&mdash;Promise, said I, taking her hand,&mdash;<i>promise</i> you will not sit up
    late on my account.&mdash;She answer'd nothing, but pressing me to her bosom, seem'd
    to tell me her heart was full of affection.</p>
    <p>The old coachman, as we drove up the lawn, eyed me attentively, saying to the
    footman, <i>It will be so, John, you may depend upon it</i>.&mdash;John answer'd only
    by a shrug.&mdash;What either meant, I shall not pretend to divine.&mdash;As I came
    near the house, I met Mr. Jenkings almost out of breath, and, pulling the string, he
    came to the coach-side. I was hurrying home, my dear young Lady, said he,
    to&mdash;to&mdash;to&mdash;Now faith I'm afraid you'll be angry.</p>
    <p>Angry with you, Sir!&mdash;angry with you, Mr. Jenkings!&mdash;is it possible!</p>
    <p>Then, to be plain, Madam, I was hurrying home, to request you would wear no
    cap.&mdash;Never shall I forget how pretty you look'd, when I saw you without
    one!&mdash;Of all things, I would <i>this day</i> wish you might look your best.</p>
    <p>To satisfy him I had taken some little pains in honour to the family, I let back
    the hood of my cloke.&mdash;He examin'd the manner in which my hair was dress'd, and
    smiled his approbation;&mdash;which <i>smile</i>, though only seen in the eyes, was
    more expressive than a contraction of all the other features.&mdash;Wishing me a
    happy day, he bid the coachman drive on.</p>
    <p>Coming within sight of the Abbey, my heart beat as if breaking from
    confinement.&mdash;I was oblig'd to call it to a severe trial,&mdash;to ask, Why this
    insurrection,&mdash;whence these tumults?&mdash;My monitor reply'd, Beware of
    self-sufficiency,&mdash;beware of its mortifying consequences.&mdash;</p>
    <p>How seasonable this warning against the worst of foes!&mdash;a foe which I too
    much fear was stealing on me imperceptibly,&mdash;else why did I not before feel
    those sensations?&mdash;Could I receive greater honour than has been conferr'd on me
    by the noblest mind on earth!&mdash;by <i>Lady Mary?</i>&mdash;Could I behold greater
    splendor than <i>Lady Mary</i> is possess'd of!&mdash;What affection in another can I
    ever hope for like <i>Lady Mary's!</i>&mdash;Thus was I arguing with myself, when the
    coach-door open'd, and a servant conducted me to the drawing-room,&mdash;where, I was
    receiv'd by Sir James and Lady Powis with an air of polite tenderness;&mdash;a kind
    of unreserve, that not only supports the timid mind, but dignifies every
    word,&mdash;every action,&mdash;and gives to education and address their highest
    polish.</p>
    <p>Lord Darcey was sitting in the window, a book in his hand;&mdash;he came forward
    as Sir James introduc'd me, who said, <i>Now</i>, my Lord, the company of <i>this</i>
    young Lady will make your Lordship's time pass more agreeably, than it could have
    done in the conversation of two old people.&mdash;My spirits were flutter'd; I really
    don't recollect his reply; only that it shew'd him master of the great art, to make
    every one pleas'd with themselves.</p>
    <p>Shall I tell you, my dear Lady, what are my thoughts of <i>this</i> Lord
    Darcey?&mdash;To confess then, though his person is amazingly elegant, his manners
    are still more engaging.&mdash;This I look upon to be the natural consequence of a
    mind illumin'd with uncommon understanding, sweetness, and refinement.</p>
    <p>A short time before dinner the chaplain made his appearance,&mdash;a venerable old
    man, with hair white as snow:&mdash;what renders his figure to be completely
    venerated, is the loss of sight.&mdash;Her Ladyship rising from her seat, led me
    towards him: Mr. Watson, said she, I am going to introduce a lady whose <i>brightest
    charms</i> will soon be visible to you.&mdash;The best man in the world! whisper'd
    she, putting my hand in his;&mdash;which hand I could not avoid putting to my
    lips.&mdash;<i>Thank</i> you, Miss Warley, said her Ladyship, <i>we all</i> revere
    this gentleman.&mdash;Mr. Watson was affected, some drops stole from their dark
    prisons, and he bless'd me as if I had been his daughter:&mdash;my pleasure was
    exquisite,&mdash;it seem'd as if I had receiv'd the benediction of an angel.</p>
    <p>Our subjects turn'd more on the celestial than the terrestrial, till dinner was
    serv'd up,&mdash;when I found that good <i>knight</i> which has been so long banish'd
    to the side-board, replac'd in his original station.</p>
    <p>How different <i>this table</i> from many others! where genteel sprightly
    conversations are shut out; <i>where</i> such as cannot feast their senses on the
    genius of a <i>cook</i>, must rise unsatisfied.</p>
    <p>A similitude of manners between your <i>Ladyship</i> and <i>Lady Powis</i>,
    particularly in doing the honours of the table, struck me so much, that I once or
    twice call'd her <i>Lady Mary</i>.&mdash;Pray, Miss Warley, ask'd she, who is this
    Lady Mary?</p>
    <p>What could occasion her confusion!&mdash;what could occasion the confusion of Sir
    James!&mdash;Never did I see any thing equal it, when I said it was Lady Mary
    Sutton!&mdash;The significant looks that were interchang'd, spoke some
    mystery;&mdash;a mystery it would be presumption in me to dive after. Her Ladyship
    made no reply,&mdash;Sir James was eager to vary the subject,&mdash;and the
    conversation became general.</p>
    <p>Though autumn is far advanc'd, every thing here wears the face of
    spring.&mdash;The afternoon being remarkably fine Lady Powis, Lord Darcey, and
    myself, strolled out amongst the sweets.&mdash;We walk'd a considerable time; his
    Lordship was all gaiety, talk'd with raptures of the improvements; declar'd every
    thing he had seen abroad fell short of this delightful spot; and <i>now</i>, my dear
    Lady Powis, added he, with an air of gallantry, I can see <i>nothing</i> wanting.</p>
    <p><i>Nothing</i> wanting! return'd her Ladyship, sighing:&mdash;Ah! my Lord,
    <i>you</i> are not a parent!&mdash;you feel nothing of a parent's
    woe!&mdash;<i>you</i> do not hourly regret the absence of a beloved and only son!
    Don't look serious, my dear Lord, seeing him somewhat abash'd, you have hitherto
    tenderly loved me.&mdash;Perhaps I had a mind to augment your affection, by bringing
    to your recollection I was not happy.&mdash;His Lordship made no reply, but, taking
    her hand, lifted it respectfully to his lips.</p>
    <p>Mr. Jenkings is this moment coming up the lawn. I see him from
    window;&mdash;excuse me, my dear Lady, whilst I step to ask him how he does.</p>
    <p>I have been accounting to Mr. Jenkings for not coming home last night. Good man!
    every mark of favour I receive, enlightens <i>his countenance</i>.&mdash;The reasons
    I have given him, I shall now proceed to give your Ladyship.</p>
    <p>I said we were walking;&mdash;I have said the conversation was
    interesting;&mdash;but I have not said it was interrupted by Sir James and Mr.
    Watson, who join'd us just as Lord Darcey had quitted the hand of Lady Powis.&mdash;A
    visit was propos'd to the Dairy-house, which is about a mile from the Abbey.&mdash;In
    our way thither, I was full of curiosity, full of inquiries about the neighbourhood,
    and whose seats <i>such</i> and <i>such</i> were, that enrich'd adjacent
    hills?&mdash;The neighbourhood, reply'd her Ladyship, is in general polite and
    hospitable.&mdash;<i>Yes</i>, said Sir James, and more smart young men, <i>Miss
    Warley</i>, than are to be met with in <i>every</i> county.&mdash;Yonder, continued
    he, live Mr. and Mrs. Finch,&mdash;very rich,&mdash;very prudent, and very
    worthy;&mdash;they have one son, a discreet lad, who seems to promise he will inherit
    their good qualities.</p>
    <p><i>That</i> which you see so surrounded with woods, is Sir Thomas Slater's, a
    <i>batchelor</i> of fifty-five; and, let me tell you, fair Lady, the pursuit of
    <i>every</i> girl in the neighbourhood;&mdash;his estate a clear nine thousand
    a-year, and&mdash;Hold, hold, interrupted Lord Darcey, in compassion to <i>us</i>
    young fellows, say no more of this <i>redoubtable</i> batchelor.</p>
    <p>Well then, continued Sir James, since my Lord <i>will</i> have it so,&mdash;let me
    draw your eye, Miss Warley, from Sir Thomas Slater's, and fix it on Lord Allen's:
    Observe the situation!&mdash;Nothing can be more beautiful, the mind of its owner
    excepted.</p>
    <p><i>That</i> house on the left is Mr. Winter's.&mdash;Chance!&mdash;<i>Strange
    chance!</i>&mdash;has just put him in possession of an immense fortune, with which he
    is going to purchase a <i>coronet</i> for his daughter.&mdash;The fellow does not
    know what to do with his <i>money</i>, and has at last found an <i>ape</i> of
    quality, that will take <i>it</i> off his hands.</p>
    <p>In this manner was Sir James characterising his neighbours, when a sudden and
    violent storm descended.&mdash;Half a mile from the <i>Dairy-house</i>, the rain fell
    in such torrents, that we were wet through, before a friendly oak offer'd us its
    shelter.&mdash;Never shall I forget my own or Lord Darcey's figure: he stripp'd
    himself of his coat, and would have thrown it over Lady Powis. Her Ladyship
    absolutely refusing it, her cloak being thick, mine the reverse, he forc'd it upon
    me. Sir James a assisting to put my arms into the sleeves.&mdash;Nor was I yet enough
    of the amazon:&mdash;they even compell'd me to exchange my hat for his, lapping it,
    about my ears.&mdash;What a strange <i>metamorphose!</i>&mdash;I cannot think of it
    without laughing!&mdash;To complete the scene, no exchange could be made, till we
    reach'd the Abbey.&mdash;In this droll situation, we waited for the coach; and
    getting, in, streaming from head to toe, it more resembled a bathing machine, than
    any other vehicle.</p>
    <p>A gentleman, who, after a chace of ten hours, had taken shelter under the roof of
    Sir James, was, at our return, stamping up and down, the vestibule, disappointed both
    in his sport and dinner, shew'd an aspect cloudy as the heavens.&mdash;My
    mortification was scarce supportable, when I heard him roar out, in a voice like
    thunder, <i>What the devil have we here?</i>&mdash;I sprang to the top of the stairs
    in a moment,&mdash;there stopp'd to fetch breath; and again the same person, who had
    so genteelly accosted me, said to Lord Darcey,&mdash;<i>Great</i> improvements, upon
    my soul!&mdash;<i>You</i> are return'd a mighty pretty <i>Miss</i>.&mdash;What, is
    <i>this</i> the newest dress at Turin?&mdash;I heard no more; her Ladyship's woman
    came and shew'd me to an apartment,&mdash;bringing from her Lady's wardrobe a chints
    n&eacute;glig&eacute;e, and a suit of flower'd muslin; in which I was soon
    equipp'd.</p>
    <p>Lady Powis sent to desire I would come to her dressing room; and, embracing me as
    I entered, said, with, an air of charming freedom, If you are not hurt, my dear, by
    our little excursion, I shall be quite in spirits this evening.</p>
    <p>I am only hurt by your Ladyship's goodness. Indeed, return'd she, I have not a
    close heart, but no one ever found so quick a passage to it as yourself.&mdash;Oh!
    Lady Mary, <i>this</i> is surely a <i>heart</i> like yours!&mdash;A <i>heart</i> like
    Mrs. Whitmore's!&mdash;Was you not surpris'd, <i>my dear</i>, continued her Ladyship,
    to be so accosted by the gentleman below?&mdash;Take no notice of what is said by Mr.
    Morgan.&mdash;that is his name;&mdash;he means well, and never goes into any person's
    house, but where his oddities are indulg'd.&mdash;I am particularly civil to him; he
    was an old school-fellow of Sir James's, one whose purse was always open to
    him.&mdash;Sir James, Miss Warley, was rather addicted to extravagance in the
    beginning of his life;&mdash;<i>that</i>, in some respects, is revers'd
    latterly.&mdash;I have been a sufferer,&mdash;yet is he a tender generous husband.
    One day you shall know more.&mdash;I <i>had</i> a son, Miss Warley&mdash;Here Sir
    James interrupted her.&mdash;I come to tell you, said he, that Lord Darcey and myself
    are impatient for our tea.</p>
    <p>O fie! Sir James, return'd Lady Powis, talk of impatience before an unmarried
    Lady!&mdash;If you go on at this rate, you will frighten her from any connection with
    your sex.&mdash;Not at all,&mdash;not at all, said Sir James; you take us for better
    for worse.&mdash;See there, Miss Warley smiles.&mdash;I warrant she does not think my
    <i>impatience</i> unseasonable.&mdash;I was going to reply, but effectually stopped
    by her Ladyship, who said, taking my hand, Come, my dear, let us go down.&mdash;I am
    fond of finding excuses for Sir James; we will suppose it was not he who was
    impatient:&mdash;we will suppose the <i>impatience</i> to be Lord Darcey's.</p>
    <p>Whilst regaling ourselves at the tea table, Mr. Morgan was in the dining-parlour,
    brightening up his features by the assitance of the cook and butler.&mdash;We were
    congratulating each other on the difference of our present and late situation,
    declaring there was nothing to regret, when Mr. Morgan enter'd.&mdash;Regret! cry'd
    he,&mdash;what do you regret?&mdash;Not, I hope, that I have made a good dinner on a
    cold sirloin and pickled oysters?&mdash;Indeed I do, said Lady Powis:&mdash;Had I
    thought you so poor a caterer, I should have taken the office on myself.&mdash;Faith
    then, reply'd he, you might have eat it yourself:&mdash;Forty years, my good Lady, I
    have made this house my home, and did I ever suffer you to direct <i>what</i>, or
    <i>when</i>, I should eat?&mdash;</p>
    <p>Sir James laugh'd aloud; so did her Ladyship:&mdash;I was inclin'd to do the
    same,&mdash;but afraid what next he would say;&mdash;However, this caution did not
    screen me from particular notice.</p>
    <p>What the duce have I here! said he, taking one of my hands,&mdash;a snow-ball by
    the colour, and feeling? and down he dropp'd it by the side of Lord Darcey's, which
    rested on the table.</p>
    <p>I was never more confounded.</p>
    <p>You are not angry, my pretty Lady, continued he:&mdash;we shall know one another
    better;&mdash;but if you displease me,&mdash;I shall thunder.&mdash;I keep all in
    subjection, except the <i>muleish kind</i>, making a low bow to Sir James. Saying
    this, he went in pursuit of Mr. Watson.&mdash;They soon re-enter'd together; a
    card-table was produc'd; and we sat down at it, whilst they solac'd themselves by a
    good fire.</p>
    <p>My attention was frequently taken from the cards, to observe how it was possible
    such opposites as Mr. Watson and Mr. Morgan cou'd be entertain'd by one another's
    conversation.&mdash;Never saw I any two seemingly more happy!&mdash;The chearfulness
    of the former augmented;&mdash;the voice of the latter at least three notes
    lower.&mdash;This has been since explain'd to me by Lady Powis.&mdash;Mr. Morgan, she
    says, notwithstanding his rough appearance, is of a nature so compassionate, that, to
    people defective in person or fortune, he is the gentlest creature breathing.</p>
    <p>Our party broke up at nine.&mdash;I sat half an hour after supper, then propos'd
    returning to Mr. Jenkings's.&mdash;Lady Powis would not hear me on this
    subject&mdash;I must stay that night at the Abbey:&mdash;venturing out such weather
    would hazard my health.&mdash;So said Sir James; so said Lord Darcey.&mdash;As for
    Mr. Morgan, he swore, Was he the former, his horses should not stir out for fifty
    pieces, unless, said he, Sir James chooses to be a fellow-sufferer with Lord Allen,
    who I have led such a chace this day, that he was forced to leave poor Snip on the
    forest.&mdash;Saying which, he threw himself back in the chair, and fell into a sound
    sleep.&mdash;About eleven I retir'd to my chamber;&mdash;a message first being sent
    to Mr. Jenkings.&mdash;Instead of going immediately to bed, I sat down and indulg'd
    myself with the satisfaction of writing to my beloved Lady Mary.&mdash;This morning I
    got up early to finish my packet; and though I have spent half an hour with Mr.
    Jenkings, shall close it before her Ladyship is stirring.</p>
    <p>Your commands, my dear Lady, are executed.&mdash;I have wrote Mrs. Smith; and as
    soon as I receive her answer, shall, with a joyful heart, with impatient fondness,
    prepare to throw at your Ladyship's feet,</p>
    <p>Your much honour'd,</p>
    <p>and affectionate,</p>

    <p>Lord DARCEY to the Honourable GEORGE MOLESWORTH.</p>
    <p><i>Barford Abbey</i>.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Prepare your ten pieces, George!&mdash;Upon my honour, I was at Barford Abbey a
    quarter before three, notwithstanding a detention on the road by Lord Michell and
    Flecher, driving on Jehu for Bath, in his Lordship's phaeton and fix.&mdash;You have
    seen them before this,&mdash;and, I suppose, know their errand.&mdash;The girl is an
    egregious fool, that is certain.&mdash;I warrant there are a hundred bets
    depending.&mdash;I ask'd what he intended doing with her if he
    succeeded?&mdash;<i>Do</i> with her! said his Lordship; why, she is not more than
    eighteen; let her go to school: faith, Flecher, that's my advice.&mdash;<i>Let her
    go</i> to the devil after I am once sure of her, return'd the lover; and, whipping up
    the horses; drove away like lightning.</p>
    <p>Be serious&mdash;Answer me one serious question,&mdash;Is it not
    possible,&mdash;<i>very</i> possible, to have a regard, a <i>friendship</i>, for an
    amiable girl, without endangering her peace or my own?&mdash;If I am further involv'd
    than <i>friendship</i>,&mdash;the blame is not mine; it will lie at the door of Sir
    James and Lady Powis.&mdash;Talk no more of Lady Elizabeth's smile, or Miss Grevel's
    hair&mdash;Stuff!&mdash;meer stuff! nor keep me up after a late evening, to hear your
    nonsense of Miss Compton's fine neck and shoulders, or Fanny Middleton's
    eyes.&mdash;Come here next week, I will insure you a sight of all those graces in one
    form. Come, I say, you will be welcome to Sir James and his Lady as
    myself.&mdash;Miss Warley will smile on you.&mdash;What other inducement can you
    want?&mdash;Don't be too vain of Miss Warley's smiles; <i>for know</i>, she cannot
    look without them.</p>
    <p>Who is Miss Warley?&mdash;What is Miss Warley?&mdash;you ask.&mdash;To your first
    question I can only answer, A visitor at Jenkings's.&mdash;To the second,&mdash;She
    is what has been so much sought after in every age, perfect harmony of mind and
    person.&mdash;Such a hand, George&mdash;</p>
    <p>Already have I been here eight days:&mdash;was I to measure time, I should call
    them hours.&mdash;My affairs with Sir James will take up longer in settling than I
    apprehended.&mdash;Come therefore this week or the next, I charge you.&mdash;Come as
    you hope to see Miss Warley. What do you think Sir James said to me the other
    day?&mdash;Was Miss Warley a girl of fortune, I should think her born for you,
    Darcey.&mdash;As that is not the case,&mdash;take care of your heart, my
    Lord.&mdash;She will never attempt to drag you into scrapes:&mdash;your little
    favourite robin, that us'd to peck from your hand, has not less guile.</p>
    <p>No! he will never consent;&mdash;I must only think of <i>friendship</i>.</p>
    <p>Lady Powis doats on this paragon of beauty: scarce within their walls,&mdash;when
    she was mention'd with such a just profusion of praises, as fill'd me with
    impatience.&mdash;Lady Powis is a heavenly woman.&mdash;You do not laugh;&mdash;many
    would, for supposing any of that sex <i>heavenly</i> after fifty.&mdash;The coach is
    this moment going for Miss Warley;&mdash;it waits only for me;&mdash;I am often her
    conductor.&mdash;Was <i>you</i> first minister of state,&mdash;I the humble suitor

    <p>Confound your friendships!&mdash;<i>Friendship</i> indeed!&mdash;What! up head and
    ears in love, and not know it.&mdash;So it is necessary for every woman you think
    capable of friendship, to have fine eyes, fine hair, a bewitching smile, and a neck
    delicately turn'd.&mdash;Have not I the highest opinion of my cousin Dolly's
    sincerity?&mdash;Do I not think her very capable of <i>friendship?</i>&mdash;Yet,
    poor soul, her eyes are planted so deep, it requires good ones to discover she has
    any.&mdash;Such a hand, George!&mdash;Such a hand, Darcey!&mdash;Why, Lady Dorothy
    too has hands; I am often enough squeez'd by them:&mdash;though hard as a horse's
    hoof, and the colour of tanned leather, I hold her capable of
    <i>friendship</i>.&mdash;Neck she has none,&mdash;smile she has none! yet need I the
    determination of another, to tell me whether my regard for her proceeds from love or
    <i>friendship?</i>&mdash;Awake,&mdash;Awake, Darcey,&mdash;Awake:&mdash;Have you any
    value for your own peace?&mdash;have you any for that of Miss Warley's? If so, leave
    Barford Abbey.&mdash;Should you persist in loving her, for love her I know you
    do?&mdash;Should the quiet of such an amiable woman as you describe be at stake? To
    deal plainly, I will come down and propose the thing myself.&mdash;No sword,&mdash;no
    pistol. I mean not for <i>myself</i>, but one whose happiness is dear to me as my
    <i>own</i>.</p>
    <p>Suppose your estate is but two thousand a-year, are you so fond of shew and
    equipage, to barter real felicity for baubles?&mdash;I am angry,&mdash;so angry, that
    it would not grieve me to see you leading to the altar an old hobbling dowager
    without a tooth.&mdash;Be more yourself,</p>

    do love Miss Warley;&mdash;but why this to you?&mdash;Your penetration has already
    discover'd it.&mdash;Yet, O Molesworth! such insurmountable obstacles:&mdash;no
    declaration can be made,&mdash;at least whilst I continue in this neighbourhood.</p>
    <p>Sir James would rave at my imprudence.&mdash;Lady Powis, whatever are her
    sentiments, must give them up to his opinion.&mdash;Inevitably I lose the affection
    of persons I have sacredly&mdash;promised to obey,&mdash;sacredly.&mdash;Was not my
    promise given to a dying father?&mdash;Miss Warley has no tye; yet, by the duty she
    observes to Sir James and Lady Powis, you would think her bound by the strongest
    cords of nature.</p>
    <p>Scarce a moment from her:&mdash;at Jenkings's every morning;&mdash;on foot if good
    weather,&mdash;else in the coach for the convenience of bringing her with me.&mdash;I
    am under no constraint:&mdash;Sir James and her Ladyship seem not the least
    suspicious: this I much wonder at, in the former particularly.</p>
    <p>In my <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;tes</i> with Miss Warley, what think you are
    our subjects?&mdash;Chiefly divinity, history, and geography.&mdash;Of these studies
    she knows more than half the great men who have wrote for ages past.&mdash;On a taste
    for the two latter I once prided myself.&mdash;An eager pursuit for the former
    springs up in my mind, whilst conversing with her, like a plant long hid in the
    earth, and called out by the appearance of a summer's sun.&mdash;This sun must shine
    at Faulcon Park;&mdash;without it all will be dreary:&mdash;<i>yet</i> how can I draw
    it thither?&mdash;<i>Edmund</i>&mdash;but why should I fear <i>Edmund?</i></p>
    <p>Will you, or will you not, meet your old friend Finch here next
    Wednesday?&mdash;Be determined in your answer.&mdash;I have suspence enough on my
    hands to be excused from any on your account.&mdash;Sir James thinks it unkind you
    have not called on him since I left England;&mdash;hasten therefore to make up
    matters with the baronet,&mdash;Need I say the pleasure I shall have in shaking you
    by the hand?</p>

    <h2>LETTER VII.</h2>
    <p>The Hon. GEORGE MOLESWORTH to Lord DARCEY.</p>
    <p><i>Bath</i>.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Wednesday next you shall see me,&mdash;positively you shall.&mdash;Bridgman will
    be of the party.</p>
    <p>I propose an immensity of satisfaction from this visit.&mdash;Forbid it, heaven!
    Miss Warley's opposite should again give me a meeting at the Abbey.&mdash;After the
    conversation I am made to expect, how should I be mortified to have my ears eternally
    dinn'd with catgut work,&mdash;painting gauze,&mdash;weaving fringes,&mdash;and
    finding out enigmas?&mdash;Setting a fine face, Miss Winter is out-done by Fletcher's
    Nancy.&mdash;A-propos, I yesterday saw that very wise girl step into a chaise and
    wheel off for Scotland, begging and praying we would make the best of it to her
    mamma.&mdash;Not the least hand had I in this affair; but, willing to help out people
    in distress, at the entreaties of Lord Michell, I waited on the old Lady at her
    lodging.</p>
    <p>I found her in a furious plight,&mdash;raving at her servants,&mdash;packing up
    her cloaths, and reflecting on her relations who had persuaded her to come to
    Bath.&mdash;When I entered she was kneeling by a huge travelling trunk, stuffing in a
    green purse at one corner, which I supposed to be full of gold.</p>
    <p>Where is Nancy?&mdash;riling from the ground, and accosting me with looks of
    fury;&mdash;Where is Nancy, Mr. Molesworth?</p>
    <p>Really, <i>Madam</i>, that is a question I cannot positively answer;&mdash;but, to
    be sincere, I believe she is on the road to Scotland.</p>
    <p><i>Believe!</i>&mdash;So you would have me think you are not one of Fletcher's
    clan.&mdash;But, tell him from me, running to the trunk after her purse, and shaking
    it just at my ear,&mdash;<i>tell him</i>, he shall never be a penny the better for
    this.</p>
    <p>I took my hat, and looked towards the door, as if going.</p>
    <p>Stop, Mr. Molesworth, (her voice somewhat lowered) why in so great a
    hurry?&mdash;I once thought you my friend. Pray inform me if Nancy was forced
    away;&mdash;or, if me went willingly.</p>
    <p>You have no right, Madam, after the treatment I have received, to expect an
    answer; but justice bids me declare her going off seemed a matter of choice.</p>
    <p>Poor child!&mdash;You was certainly trapann'd (and she put a handkerchief to her
    eyes).</p>
    <p>I solemnly protest, Madam, I have seen your daughter but twice since she came to
    Bath.&mdash;Last night, when coming from the Rooms, I saw her step into a chaise,
    followed by Mr. Fletcher.&mdash;They beckoned me towards them, whispered the
    expedition they were going upon, and requested me to break the matter to you, and
    intercede for their pardon.&mdash;My visit has not answered its salutary
    purpose&mdash;I perceive it <i>has not</i>. So saying I turned from
    her,&mdash;knowing, by old acquaintance, how I was to play my cards, me being one of
    those kind of spirits which are never quell'd but by opposition.</p>
    <p>After fetching me from the door, she promised to hear calmly what I had to
    say;&mdash;and, tho' no orator, I succeeded so well as to gain an assurance, she
    would see them at their return from Scotland.</p>
    <p>I left the old Lady in tolerable good humour, and was smiling to myself,
    recollecting the bout I had passed, when, who should come towards me but Lord
    Michell,&mdash;his countenance full-fraught with curiosity.</p>
    <p>Well, George!&mdash;dear George!&mdash;what success in your embassy?&mdash;I long
    to know the fate of honest Fletcher.&mdash;Is he to loll in a coach and
    six?&mdash;or, is the coroner's inquest to bring in their verdict Lunacy?</p>
    <p>A sweet alternative!&mdash;<i>As</i> your Lordship's assiduity has shewn the
    former is the highest pinnacle to which you would wish to lift a friend, I believe
    your most sanguine hopes are here answered.</p>
    <p>Is it <i>so!</i>&mdash;Well, if ever Fletcher offers up a prayer, it ought to be
    for you, Molesworth.</p>
    <p>Vastly good, my Lord.&mdash;What, before he prays for himself?&mdash;<i>This</i>
    shews your Lordship's <i>very</i> high notions of gratitude.</p>
    <p>We have high notions of every thing.&mdash;Bucks and bloods, as we are
    call'd,&mdash;you may go to the devil before you will find a set of honester
    fellows.</p>
    <p>To the <i>Devil</i>, my Lord!&mdash;That's true, I believe.</p>
    <p>He was going to reply when the three choice spirits came up, and hurried him, away
    to the Tuns.</p>
    <p>A word to <i>you</i>, Darcey.&mdash;Surely you are never serious in the ridiculous
    design.&mdash;Not offer yourself to Miss Warley, whilst she continues in that
    neighbourhood?&mdash;the very spot on which you ought to secure her,&mdash;unless you
    think all the young fellows who visit at the Abbey are blind, except
    yourself.&mdash;<i>Why</i>, you are jealous <i>already</i>;&mdash;<i>jealous</i> of
    <i>Edmund</i>.&mdash;Perhaps <i>even I</i> may become one of your
    tormentors.&mdash;If I like her I shall as certainly tell her <i>so, as</i> that my
    name is</p>

    <h2>LETTER VIII.</h2>
    <p>Miss WARLEY to Lady MARY SUTTON.</p>
    <p>From Mr. <i>Jenkings's</i>.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Ah! my dear Lady, how kind,&mdash;how inexpressibly kind, to promise I shall one
    day know what has put an end to the intimacy between the two Ladies I <i>so</i> much
    revere.</p>
    <p>To find your Ladyship has still a high opinion of Lady Powis, has filled me with
    pleasure.&mdash;Fear of the reverse often threw a damp on my heart, whilst receiving
    the most tender caresses.&mdash;You bid me love her!&mdash;You say I cannot love her
    too well!&mdash;<i>This</i> is a command my heart springs forward to obey.</p>
    <p>Unhappy family!&mdash;What a loss does it sustain by the absence of Mr.
    Powis?&mdash;<i>No</i>, I can never forgive the Lady who has occasioned this source
    of sorrow.&mdash;Why is her name concealed?&mdash;But what would it benefit me to
    come at a knowledge of it?</p>
    <p>Pity Sir James should rather see such a son <i>great</i> than happy.&mdash;Six
    thousand a year, <i>yet</i> covet a fortune twice as large!&mdash;Love of riches
    makes strange wreck in the human heart.</p>
    <p>Why did Mr. Powis leave his native country?&mdash;The refusal of a Lady with whom
    he only sought an union in obedience to his father, could not <i>greatly</i> affect
    him.&mdash;Was not such an overture <i>without</i> affection,&mdash;<i>without</i>
    inclination,&mdash;a blot in his fair character?&mdash;Certainly it was.&mdash;Your
    Ladyship seems to think Sir James only to blame.&mdash;I dare not have presumed to
    offer my opinion, had you not often told me, it betray'd a meanness to hide our real
    sentiments, when call'd upon to declare them.</p>
    <p>Lady Powis yesterday obliged me with a sight of several letters from her
    son.&mdash;<i>I</i> am not mistress of a stile like <i>his</i>, or your Ladyship
    would have been spar'd numberless tedious moments.&mdash;Such extraordinary deckings
    are seldom to be met with in common minds.</p>
    <p>I told Lady Powis, last evening, that I should devote this day to my pen;&mdash;so
    I shall not be sent for;&mdash;a favour I am sure to have conferr'd if I am not at
    the Abbey soon after breakfast.&mdash;Lord Darcey is frequently my escort.&mdash;I am
    pleased to see that young nobleman regard Edmund as if of equal rank with
    himself.</p>
    <p>Heavens! his Lordship is here!&mdash;full-dressed, and just alighted from the
    coach,&mdash;to fetch me, I fear.&mdash;I shall know in a moment; Mrs. Jenkings is
    coming up.</p>
    <p>Even so.&mdash;It vexes me to be thus taken off from my agreeable task;&mdash;yet
    I cannot excuse myself,&mdash;her Ladyship is importunate.&mdash;She sends me word I
    <i>must</i> come;&mdash;that I <i>must</i> return with Lord Darcey.&mdash;Mrs. Finch
    is accidentally dropp'd in with her son.&mdash;I knew the latter was expected to meet
    two gentlemen from Bath,&mdash;one of them an intimate friend of Lord
    Darcey.&mdash;Mrs. Finch is an amiable woman;&mdash;it is to her Lady Powis wants to
    introduce me.</p>
    <p><i>Your Servant, my Lord</i>.&mdash;A very genteel way to hasten me
    down&mdash;impatient, I suppose, to see his friend from Bath.&mdash;<i>Well</i>,
    Jenny, tell his Lordship it will be needless to have the horses taken out.&mdash;I
    shall be ready in a quarter of an hour.&mdash;Adieu, my dear Lady.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Eleven o'clock at night.</p>
    <p>Every thing has conspired to make this day more than commonly agreeable.&mdash;It
    requires the pen of a Littelton to paint the different graces which shone in
    conversation.&mdash;As no such pen is at hand, will your Ladyship receive from
    <i>mine</i> a short description of the company at the Abbey?</p>
    <p>Mrs. Finch is about seven and forty;&mdash;her person plain,&mdash;her mind
    lovely,&mdash;her bosom fraught with happiness.&mdash;She dispenses it
    promiscuously.&mdash;Every smile,&mdash;every accent,&mdash;conveys it to all around
    her.&mdash;A countenance engagingly open.&mdash;Her purse too, I am told, when
    occasions offer, open as her heart.&mdash;How largely is she repaid for her balsamic
    gifts,&mdash;by seeing those virtues early planted in the mind of her son, spring up
    and shoot in a climate where a blight is almost contagious!</p>
    <p>Mr. Finch is the most sedate young man I have ever seen;&mdash;but his sedateness
    is temper'd with a <i>sweetness</i> inexpressible;&mdash;a certain mildness in the
    features;&mdash;<i>a mildness</i> which, in the countenance of that great commander I
    saw at Brandon Lodge, appears like <i>mercy</i> sent out from the heart to discover
    the dwelling of <i>true courage</i>.&mdash;There is certainly a strong likeness
    between the Marquis and Lord Darcey;&mdash;<i>so strong</i>, that when I first beheld
    his Lordship I was quite struck with surprize.</p>
    <p>Mr. Molesworth and Mr. Bridgman, the two gentlemen from Bath, are very opposite to
    each other in person and manner; yet both in a different degree seem to be worthy
    members of society.</p>
    <p>Mr. Molesworth, a most entertaining companion,&mdash;vastly chearful,&mdash;smart
    at repartee; and, from the character Lord Darcey has given me of him, very
    sincere.</p>
    <p>Mr. Bridgman has a good deal the air of a foreigner; attained, I suppose, by his
    residence some years at the court of &mdash;&mdash;, in a public
    character.&mdash;Very fit he appears for such an
    employ.&mdash;Sensible,&mdash;remarkably polite,&mdash;speaks all languages with the
    same fluency as his own; but then a veil of disagreeable reserve throws a dark shade
    over those perfections.&mdash;<i>Perhaps</i> I am wrong to spy out faults so
    early;&mdash;<i>perhaps</i> to-morrow my opinion may be different.&mdash;First
    prepossessions&mdash;Ah! What would I have said of <i>first
    prepossessions?</i>&mdash;Is it not to them I owe a thousand blessings?&mdash;I, who
    have nothing to recommend me but being unfortunate.</p>
    <p>Somthing lies at my heart.&mdash;Yet I think I could not sleep in quiet, was I to
    drop a hint in disfavour of Mr. Jenkings;&mdash;it may not be in his <i>disfavour</i>
    neither:&mdash;However, my dear Lady, you shall be the judge, after I have repos'd a
    few hours.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Seven o'clock in the morning.</p>
    <p>Why should I blame Mr. Jenkings?&mdash;Is not Edmund his only son?&mdash;his only
    child?&mdash;Is he less my friend for suspecting?&mdash;Yes, my Lady, I perceive he
    does <i>suspect</i>.&mdash;He is uneasy.&mdash;He supposes his son encouraging an
    improper affection.&mdash;I see it in his very looks:&mdash;he must think me an
    artful creature.&mdash;This it is that distresses me.&mdash;I wish I could hit on a
    method to set his heart at rest.&mdash;If I barely hint a design of leaving the
    neighbourhood, which I have done once or twice, he bursts into tears, and I am
    oblig'd to sooth him like a child.</p>
    <p>How account for this behaviour?&mdash;Why does he look on me with the eye of
    fatherly affection,&mdash;yet think me capable of a meanness I <i>despise?</i></p>
    <p>I believe it impossible for a human being to have <i>more</i> good nature, or
    <i>more</i> good qualities, than Edmund; yet had he the riches of a Mogul, I could
    never think of a connection with him.&mdash;<i>He</i>, worthy young man, has never
    given his father cause for <i>suspicion</i>.&mdash;I am convinced he has
    not.&mdash;Naturally of an obliging disposition, he is ever on the watch for
    opportunities to gratify his amiable inclinations:&mdash;not <i>one</i> such selfish
    motive as love to push him on.</p>
    <p>A summons to breakfast.&mdash;Lord Darcey, it seems, is below;&mdash;I suppose,
    slid away from his friends to call on Edmund.&mdash;Mr. and Mrs. Jenkings are
    <i>all</i> smiles, <i>all</i> good humour, to their son,&mdash;I hope it is only I
    who have been <i>suspicious</i>.&mdash;Lord Darcey is still with Edmund.&mdash;They
    are at this moment under my window,&mdash;counselling perhaps, about a commission he
    wants his father to purchase for him in the Guards.&mdash;I should be glad to see
    this matter accommodated;&mdash;yet, I could wish, in <i>so</i> tender a point, his
    Lordship may not be <i>too</i> forward in advising.&mdash;Mr. and Mrs. Jenkings have
    such an opinion of him,&mdash;they pay such deference to what he says,&mdash;his
    advice <i>must</i> have weight;&mdash;and they <i>may</i> be unhappy by giving up
    their inclinations.</p>
    <p>The praises of Lord Darcey are forever sounding in my ears.&mdash;To what a height
    would the partiality of Mrs. Jenkings lift me?&mdash;She would have me think,&mdash;I
    cannot tell your Ladyship what she would <i>have me think</i>.&mdash;My hopes dare
    not take <i>such</i> a flight.&mdash;No!&mdash;I can perceive what their fall
    <i>must</i> be;&mdash;I can perceive <i>it</i>, without getting on the top of the
    precipice to look down.</p>
    <p>I shall order every thing for my departure, according to your Ladyship's
    directions, holding myself in readiness to attend Mr. and Mrs. Smith, at the time
    proposed.</p>
    <p>Oxfordshire I must revisit,&mdash;for a few days only;&mdash;having some little
    matters to regulate.</p>
    <p>The silks I have purchas'd for your Ladyship are slight, as you directed, except a
    white and gold, which is the richest and most beautiful I could procure.</p>
    <p>How imperceptibly time slides on?&mdash;The clock strikes eleven,&mdash;in spight
    of the desire I have of communicating many things more.&mdash;An engagement to be
    with Lady Powis at twelve hastens me to conclude myself</p>
    <p>Your Ladyship's</p>
    <p>Most honour'd and affectionate,</p>
    <p>F. WARLEY.</p>

    <h2>LETTER IX.</h2>
    <p>The Honourable GEORGE MOLESWORTH to LORD DARCEY.</p>
    <p><i>Bath</i>.</p>
    <br />

    <p>What a sacrifice do you offer up to that old dog Plutus!&mdash;I have lost
    <i>all</i> patience,&mdash;<i>all</i> patience, I say.&mdash;<i>Such</i> a
    woman!&mdash;<i>such</i> an angelic woman!&mdash;But what has,&mdash;what will avail
    my arguments?&mdash;Her peace is gone,&mdash;if you persevere in a behaviour so
    <i>particular</i>,&mdash;absolutely gone.</p>
    <p>Bridgman this morning told me, that unless I assured him you had
    <i>pretensions</i> to Miss Warley, he was determined to offer her his
    hand;&mdash;<i>that</i> nothing prevented him from doing it whilst at the Abbey, but
    your mysterious conduct, which he was at a loss how to construe. &mdash;Not to offend
    <i>you</i>, the <i>Lady</i> or <i>family</i> she is with, he apply'd, he said, to
    <i>me</i>, as a friend of each party, to set him right.</p>
    <p>Surely, Bridgman, returned I, you wish to keep yourself in the dark; or how the
    duce have you been six days with people whose countenances speak so much sensibility,
    and not make the discovery you seek after?</p>
    <p>Though her behaviour to us; continued I, was politeness itself, was there nothing
    more than <i>politeness</i> in her address to Lord Darcey?&mdash;Her smiles
    <i>too</i>, in which Diana and the Graces revel, saw you not <i>them</i>, how they
    played from one to another, like sun-beams on the water, until they fixed on
    him?&mdash;Is the nation in debt?&mdash;So much is Darcey in love;&mdash;and you may
    as well pay off one, as rival the other with success.</p>
    <p>Observe, my friend, in what manner I have answered for you.&mdash;Keep her,
    therefore, no longer in suspence.&mdash;Delays of this sort are not only dangerous,
    but cruel.&mdash;Why delight to torture what we most admire?&mdash;From a boy you
    despised such actions.&mdash;Often have I known Dick Jones, when at Westminster,
    threshed by your hand for picking poor little birds alive.&mdash;<i>His</i> was an
    early point;&mdash;but for <i>Darcey</i>, accoutred with the breast-plate of honour,
    even before he could read the word that signifies its intrinsic value,&mdash;<i>for
    him</i> to be falling off,&mdash;falling off at a time <i>too</i>, when Virtue
    herself appears in person to support him!</p>
    <p>Can you say, you mean not to injure her?&mdash;Is a woman only to be injured, but
    by an attempt on her virtue?&mdash;Is it <i>no</i> crime, <i>no</i> fault, to cheat a
    young innocent lovely girl out of her affections, and give her nothing in return but
    regret and disappointment?</p>
    <p>Reflect, what a task is mine, thus to lay disagreeable truths plainly before
    you.&mdash;To hear it pronounced, that Lord and Lady Darcey are the happiest couple
    on earth, is the hope that has pushed me on to this unpleasing office.</p>
    <p>Bridgman is just set out for town.&mdash;I am charg'd with a profusion of
    respects, thanks, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. which, if you have the least oeconomy, will
    serve for him, and</p>

    <p>Lord DARCEY to the Honourable GEORGE MOLESWORTH.</p>
    <p><i>Barford Abbey</i>.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Bridgman!&mdash;Could Bridgman dare aspire to Miss Warley!&mdash;<i>He</i> offer
    her his hand!&mdash;<i>he</i> be connected with a woman whose disposition is
    diametrically opposite to his own!&mdash;<i>No</i>,&mdash;that would not have done,
    though I had never seen her.&mdash;Let him seek for one who has a heart shut up by a
    thousand locks.</p>
    <p>After his <i>own</i> conjectures,&mdash;after what <i>you</i> have told
    him,&mdash;should he <i>but</i> attempt to take her from me, by all that is sacred,
    he shall repent it dearly.</p>
    <p>Molesworth! <i>you</i> are my friend,&mdash;I take your admonitions
    well;&mdash;but, surely, you should not press thus hardly on my soul, knowing its
    uneasy situation.&mdash;My state is even more perplexing than when we parted:&mdash;I
    did not then know she was going to France.&mdash;<i>Yes</i>, she is absolutely going
    to <i>France</i>.&mdash;Why leave her friends here?&mdash;Why not wait the arrival of
    Lady Mary Sutton in England?</p>
    <p>I have used every dissuasive argument <i>but one</i>.&mdash;That shall be my
    last.&mdash;If <i>that</i> fails I go&mdash;I positively go with her.&mdash;It is
    your opinion that she loves me.&mdash;Would it were mine!&mdash;<i>Not</i> the least
    partiality can I discover.&mdash;Why then be precipitate?&mdash;Every moment she is
    gaining ground in the affections of Sir James and Lady Powis.&mdash;<i>Time</i> may
    work wonders in the mind of the former.&mdash;Without his consent never can I give my
    hand;&mdash;the commands of a dying father forbid me.&mdash;<i>Such</i> a
    father!&mdash;O George! you did not know him;&mdash;<i>so</i>
    revered,&mdash;<i>so</i> honour'd,&mdash;<i>so</i> belov'd! not more in public than
    in private life.</p>
    <p><i>My friend</i>, behold your son!&mdash;<i>Darcey</i>, behold your
    father!&mdash;<i>As</i> you reverence and obey Sir James, <i>as</i> you consult him
    on all occasions, <i>as</i> you are guided by his advice, receive my
    blessing.&mdash;These were his parting words, hugg'd into me in his last cold
    embrace.&mdash;No, George, the promise I made can never be forfeited.&mdash;I sealed
    it on his lifeless hand, before I was borne from him.</p>
    <p><i>Now</i>, are you convinc'd no mean views with-hold me?&mdash;You despise not
    more than I do the knave and coxcomb; for no other, to satiate their own vanity,
    would sport away the quiet of a fellow-creature.&mdash;Well may you call it
    cruel.&mdash;<i>Such</i> cruelties fall little short of those practised by
    <i>Nero</i> and <i>Caligula</i>.</p>
    <p>Did it depend on myself only, I would tell Miss Warley I love, <i>every time</i> I
    behold her enchanting face; <i>every time</i> I hear the voice of wisdom springing
    from the seat of innocence.</p>
    <p>No shadow of gaining over Sir James!&mdash;<i>Efforts</i> has not been
    wanting:&mdash;I mean <i>efforts</i> to declare my inclination.&mdash;I have follow'd
    him like a ghost for days past, thinking at every step how I should bless <i>this</i>
    or <i>that</i> spot on which he consented to my happiness.&mdash;Pleasing
    phantoms!&mdash;How have they fled at sight of his determin'd
    countenance!&mdash;Methought I could trace <i>in it</i> the same obduracy which
    nature vainly pleaded to remove.&mdash;In <i>other</i> matters my heart is
    resolute;&mdash;<i>here</i> an errant coward.&mdash;No! I cannot break it to him
    whilst in Hampshire.&mdash;When I get to town, a letter <i>shall</i> speak for
    me.&mdash;Sometimes I am tempted to trust the secret to Lady Powis.&mdash;She is
    compassionate;&mdash;she would even risk her own peace to preserve mine.&mdash;Again
    the thoughts of involving her in fresh perplexities determines me against it.</p>
    <p>Had my father been acquainted with that part of Sir James's character which
    concerned his son, I am convinc'd he would have made some restrictions in regard to
    the explicit obedience he enjoined.&mdash;But all was hushed whilst Mr. Powis
    continued on his travels; nor, until he settled abroad, did any one suspect there had
    been a family disagreement:&mdash;<i>even</i> at <i>this</i> time the whole affair is
    not generally known.&mdash;The name of the lady to whom he was obliged to make
    proposals, is in particular carefully concealed.&mdash;I, who from ten years old have
    been bred up with them, am an entire stranger to it.&mdash;<i>Perhaps</i> no part of
    the affair would ever have transpired, had not Sir James made some discoveries, in
    the first agitation of his passion, before a large company, when he received an
    account of Mr. Powis's being appointed to the government of &mdash;&mdash;. No secret
    can be safe in a breast where every passage is not well guarded against an enemy
    which, like lightning, throws up all before it.</p>
    <p>Let me not forget to tell you, amongst a multiplicity of concerns crowding on my
    mind, that I have positively deny'd Edmund to intercede with his father regarding the
    commission.&mdash;A bare surmise that he is my rival, has silenced me.&mdash;Was I
    ungenerous enough to indulge myself in getting rid of him, an opportunity now
    offers;&mdash;but I am <i>as</i> averse to such proceedings as <i>he</i> ought to be

    <h2>LETTER XI.</h2>
    <p>The Honourable GEORGE MOLESWORTH to Lord DARCEY.</p>
    <p><i>Bath</i>.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Believe me, my dear Lord, I never suspected you capable of designs you justly hold
    in abhorrence.&mdash;If I expressed myself warmly, it was owing to your keeping from
    me the knowledge of those particulars which have varied every circumstance.&mdash;I
    saw my friend a poor restless being, irresolute, full of perplexities.&mdash;I felt
    for him.&mdash;I rejoice now to find from whence this <i>irresolution</i>, those
    <i>perplexities</i> arose.&mdash;She is,&mdash;she must,&mdash;by heaven! she shall
    be yours:&mdash;A reward fit only for <i>such</i> great&mdash;<i>such</i> noble
    resolutions.</p>
    <p>You talk of a <i>last</i> argument&mdash;Forbear <i>that</i> argument.&mdash;You
    <i>must</i> not use it before you have laid your intentions open to Sir
    James.&mdash;<i>Neither</i> follow her to France.&mdash;What, as you are situated,
    would <i>that</i> avail?&mdash;Prevent her going, <i>if</i> you
    can.&mdash;<i>Such</i> a woman, under the protection of Lady Mary Sutton, <i>must</i>
    have many advantageous proposals.</p>
    <p>I understand <i>nothing</i> of features,&mdash;I know <i>nothing</i> of
    physiognomy, if you have any uneasiness from Bridgman.&mdash;It was not marks of a
    violent passion he betrayed;&mdash;rather, I think, an ambition of having his taste
    approved by the world;&mdash;but we shall know more of the matter when I meet him in
    town.</p>
    <p>Stupidity!&mdash;Not see her partiality!&mdash;not see that she loves
    you!&mdash;She will some time hence own it as frankly with her lips, as her eyes have
    told you a thousand times, did you understand their language.&mdash;The duce a word
    could <i>I</i> get from them.&mdash;Very uncivil, I think, not to <i>speak</i> when
    they were <i>spoke</i> to,&mdash;They will be ready enough, I suppose, with their
    <i>thanks</i> and <i>applauses</i>, when I present her hand to be united with her
    heart. That office shall be <i>mine</i>:&mdash;<i>Something</i> tells me, there is to
    be an alteration in <i>your</i> affairs, sudden as unexpected.</p>
    <p>I go to the rooms this evening for the last time.&mdash;To-morrow I set out for
    Slone Hall, in my way to London.&mdash;Here I shall spend two or three days happily
    with my good-natured cousin Lady Dorothy.&mdash;Perhaps we may take an airing
    together as far as your territories.&mdash;I shall <i>now</i> look on Faulcon-Park
    with double pleasure.&mdash;Neither that or the agreeable neighbourhood round it will
    be ever bridled over by a haughty dame.&mdash;(Miss Warley, forbid it.)&mdash;Some
    such we see in <i>high</i> as well as <i>low</i> life.&mdash;Haughtiness is the
    reverse of true greatness; therefore it staggers me to behold it in the former.</p>
    <p>A servant with a white favour!&mdash;What can this mean?&mdash;</p>
    <p>Upon my word, Mr. Flecher, you return with your fair bride sooner than I
    expected.&mdash;<i>A card too</i>.&mdash;Things must be <i>finely</i> accommodated
    with the old Lady.&mdash;Your Lordship being at too great a distance to partake of
    the feast, pray regale on what calls me to it.</p>
    <p>"Mrs. Moor and Mr. and Mrs. Flecher's compliments to Mr. Molesworth.&mdash;My son
    and daughter are just return'd from Scotland, and hope for the pleasure of Mr.
    Molesworth's company with eight or ten other friends, to congratulate them this
    evening on their arrival.&mdash;Both the Ladies and Mr. Flecher will be much
    disappointed, if you do not accept our invitation."</p>
    <p>True as I live, <i>neither added</i> or <i>diminished</i> a tittle,&mdash;and
    wrote by the hand of Flecher's Desdemona.&mdash;Does not a man richly deserve thirty
    thousand pounds with a wife <i>like this?</i>&mdash;Not for <i>twice</i> that sum
    would I see such nonsense come from her I was to spend my life with.</p>
    <p>Pity Nature and Fortune has such frequent bickerings! When one smiles the other
    frowns.&mdash;I wish the gipsies would make up matters, and send us down their
    favours wrapp'd up together.</p>
    <p>Considering the friendship you have honour'd Edmund with, I have no idea he can
    presume to think of Miss Warley, <i>seeing</i> what he must <i>see</i>.</p>
    <p>I shall expect to find a letter on my arrival in St. James's Street.&mdash;Omit
    not those respects which are due at Barford Abbey.</p>

    <h2>LETTER XII.</h2>
    <p>Lord DARCEY to the Honourable GEORGE MOLESWORTH.</p>
    <p><i>Barford Abbey</i>.</p>
    <br />

    <p>I should be in a fine plight, truly, to let her go to France without
    me!&mdash;Why, I am almost besides myself at the thoughts of an eight days
    separation.&mdash;Was ever any thing so forgetful!&mdash;To bring no other cloaths
    here but mourning!&mdash;Did she always intend to encircle the sun with a sable
    cloud?&mdash;Or, why not dispatch a servant?&mdash;A journey into Oxfordshire is
    absolutely necessary.&mdash;Some <i>other</i> business, I suppose; but I am not
    enough in her confidence to know of what nature.&mdash;Poh! love!&mdash;Impossible,
    and refuse me so small a boon as to attend her!&mdash;requested too in a manner that
    spoke my whole soul.&mdash;Yes; I had near broke through all my
    resolutions.&mdash;This I did say, If Miss Warley refuses her dear hand, pressing it
    to my lips, in the same peremptory manner,&mdash;what will become of him who without
    it is lost to the whole world?&mdash;The reply ventur'd no further than her
    cheek;&mdash;there sat enthron'd in robes of crimson.&mdash;I scarce dar'd to look
    up:&mdash;her eyes darted forth a ray so powerful, that I not only quitted her hand,
    but suffered her to leave the room without my saying another word.&mdash;This
    happened at Jenkings's last evening; in the morning she was to set out with the old
    gentleman for Oxfordshire.&mdash;I did not attempt seeing her again 'till that time,
    fearing my presence might be unpleasing, after the confusion I had occasion'd.</p>
    <p>Sick of my bed I got up at five; and taking a gun, directed my course to the only
    spot on earth capable of affording me delight.&mdash;The outer gate barr'd:&mdash;no
    appearance of any living creature, except poor Caesar.&mdash;He, hearing my voice,
    crept from his wooden-house, and, instead of barking, saluted me in a whining
    tone:&mdash;stretching himself, he jumped towards the gate, licking my hand that lay
    between the bars.&mdash;I said many kind things to this faithful beast, in hopes my
    voice would awaken some of the family.&mdash;The scheme succeeded.&mdash;A bell was
    sounded from one of the apartments; that opposite to which I stood.&mdash;A servant
    opening the window-shutters, I was tempted to keep my stand.&mdash;A white beaver
    with a green feather, and a riding-dress of the same colour, plainly told me this was
    the room where rested all my treasure, and caused in my mind such conflicts as can no
    more be described by <i>me</i> than felt by <i>another</i>.&mdash;Unwilling to
    encrease my tortures I reeled to an old tree, which lay on a bank near;&mdash;there
    sat down to recover my trembling.&mdash;The next thing which alarmed me was an empty
    chaise, driving full speed down the hill.&mdash;I knew on <i>what</i> occasion, yet
    could not forbear asking the post-boy.&mdash;He answered, To carry some company from
    yonder house.&mdash;My situation was really deplorable,&mdash;when I beheld my dear
    lovely girl walking in a pensive mood, attir'd in that very dress which I espied
    through the window.&mdash;Heavy was the load I dragged from head to heel; yet, like a
    Mercury, I flew to meet her.&mdash;She saw me,&mdash;started,&mdash;and cry'd, Bless
    me! my Lord! what brings you hither at this early hour?&mdash;The real truth was
    springing to my lips, when, recollecting her happiness might be the sacrifice, I
    said, examining the lock of my gun,&mdash;I am waiting, Miss Warley, for that lazy
    fellow Edmund:&mdash;he promised to shew me an eye of pheasants.&mdash;If you are not
    a very keen sportsman, returned she, what says your Lordship to a cup of
    chocolate?&mdash;It will not detain you long;&mdash;Mrs. Jenkings has some ready
    prepared for the travellers.</p>
    <p>She pronounced <i>travellers</i> with uncommon glee;&mdash;at least I thought
    so,&mdash;and, nettled at her indifference, could not help replying, <i>You</i> are
    <i>very</i> happy, madam;&mdash;<i>you</i> part with your friends <i>very</i>
    unreluctantly, I perceive.</p>
    <p>If any thing ever appeared in my favour, it was now.&mdash;Her confusion was
    visible;&mdash;even Edmund observed it, who just then strolled towards us, and said,
    looking at both attentively, What is the matter with Miss Warley?</p>
    <p>With me, Edmund? she retorted,&mdash;nothing ails me.&mdash;I suppose you think I
    am enough of the fine lady to complain the whole day, because I have got up an hour
    before my usual time.</p>
    <p>His tongue was <i>now</i> silent;&mdash;his eyes <i>full</i> of
    enquiries.&mdash;He fixed them on us alternately,&mdash;wanting to discover the
    situation of our hearts.&mdash;Why so curious, Edmund?&mdash;Things cannot go on long
    at this rate.&mdash;<i>Your</i> heart must undergo a strict scrutiny before I shall
    know what terms we are upon.</p>
    <p>No words can paint my gratitude for worthy Jenkings.&mdash;He went to the Abbey,
    on foot, before breakfast was ended, to give me an opportunity of supplying his place
    in the chaise.&mdash;At parting he actually took one of my hands, joined it with Miss
    Warley's, and I could perceive petitions ascending from the seat of purity.&mdash;I
    know to what they tended.&mdash;I <i>felt</i>, I <i>saw</i> them.&mdash;The chaise
    drove off. I could have blessed him.&mdash;May my blessings overtake him!&mdash;May
    they light where virtue sits enshrin'd by locks of silver.</p>
    <p>Yes, if his son was to wound me in the tenderest part, for the sake of <i>such</i>
    a father, I think,&mdash;I know not what to think.&mdash;Living in such suspence is
    next to madness.</p>
    <p>She treats him with the freedom of a sister.&mdash;She calls him
    Edmund,&mdash;leans on his arm, and suffers him to take her hand.&mdash;The least
    favour conferred on me is with an air <i>so</i> reserved, <i>so</i> distant, as if
    she would say, I have not for you the least sentiment of tenderness.</p>
    <p>Lady Powis sends to desire I will walk with her.&mdash;A sweet companion am I for
    a person in low spirits!&mdash;That her's are not high is evident.&mdash;She has shed
    many tears this morning at parting with Miss Warley.</p>
    <p>Instead of eight days mortification we might have suffer'd twenty, had not her
    Ladyship insisted on an absolute promise of returning at that time.&mdash;Farewel
    till then.</p>

    <p>Miss WARLEY to Lady MARY SUTTON.</p>
    <p><i>From the Crown, at &mdash;&mdash;</i>.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Here am I, ever-honour'd lady, forty miles on the road to that beloved spot,
    where, for nineteen years, my tranquility was uninterrupted.&mdash;Will a serene sky
    always hang over me?&mdash;It will be presumption to suppose it,&mdash;when
    thousands, perhaps, endowed with virtues the most god-like, have nothing on which
    they can look <i>back</i> but dark clouds,&mdash;nothing to which they can look
    <i>forward</i> but gathering storms.&mdash;Am I a bark only fit to sail in fair
    weather?&mdash;Shall I not prepare to meet the waves of disappointment?</p>
    <p>How does my heart bear,&mdash;how throb,&mdash;to give up follies which dare not
    hide themselves where a passage is made <i>by</i> generosity, <i>by</i> affection
    unbounded.&mdash;Yes, my dear Lady, this is the only moment I do not regret being
    absent from you;&mdash;for could my tongue relate what my pen trembles to
    discover?&mdash;No!</p>
    <p>Behold <i>me</i> at your Ladyship's feet!&mdash;behold <i>me</i> a supplicant
    suing for my returning peace!&mdash;<i>You</i> only, can restore it.&mdash;Command
    that I give up my preference for Lord Darcey, and the intruder is banished from my
    heart:&mdash;<i>then</i> shall I no more labour to deceive myself:&mdash;<i>then</i>
    shall I no more blindly exchange certain peace for doubtful happiness,&mdash;a
    <i>quiet</i> for a <i>restless</i> mind.&mdash;Humility has not fled me;&mdash;my
    heart has not fallen a sacrifice to title, pomp, or splendor.&mdash;Yet, has it not
    foolishly, unasked, given itself up?&mdash;Ah! my Lady, not entirely unask'd neither;
    or, why, from the first moment, have I seen him shew <i>such</i> tender, <i>such</i>
    respectful assiduities?&mdash;why <i>so</i> ardently solicit to attend me into
    Oxfordshire?&mdash;why ask, if I refused my hand in the same peremptory manner, what
    would become of the man who without it was lost to the whole world?&mdash;But am I
    not too vain?&mdash;Why should this man be Lord Darcey?&mdash;Rather one rising to
    his imagination, who he might possibly suppose was entrapped by my girlish
    years.&mdash;A few, a very <i>few</i> weeks, and I am gone from him forever.&mdash;If
    your Ladyship's goodness can pardon the confession I have made, no errors will I
    again commit of the kind which now lies blushing before you.</p>
    <p>Next to your Ladyship Mr. Jenkings is the best friend I have on earth.&mdash;He
    <i>never</i> has suspected, or <i>now</i> quite forgets his suspicions.&mdash;Not all
    my entreaties could prevent him from taking this long journey with me.&mdash;His age,
    his connections, his business, every thing is made subservient to my
    convenience&mdash;Whilst I write he is below, and has just sent up to know if I will
    permit a gentleman of his acquaintance, whom he has met accidentally at this inn, to
    dine with us.&mdash;Why does he use this ceremony?&mdash;I can have no objection to
    any friend of <i>his</i>.&mdash;Dinner is served up.&mdash;I shall write again at our
    last stage this evening.</p>
    <br />

    <p><i>From the Mitre at &mdash;&mdash;</i>.</p>
    <p>Past twelve at night!&mdash;An hour I used to think the most silent of
    any:&mdash;but <i>here</i> so much the reverse, one reasonably may suppose the
    inhabitants, or guests, have mistaken midnight for mid-day.</p>
    <p>I will ring and enquire, why all this noise?</p>
    <p>A strange bustle!&mdash;Something like fighting!&mdash;Very near, I
    protest.&mdash;Hark! bless me, I shall be frightened to death!&mdash;The chambermaid
    not come! Would I could find my way to Mr. Jenkings's room!&mdash;Womens voices, as I
    live!&mdash;Begging!&mdash;praying!&mdash;Ah! ah! now they cry, Take the swords
    away!&mdash;Take the swords away!&mdash;Heaven defend us! to be sure we shall be all
    killed.</p>
    <br />

    <p><i>One o'clock</i>.</p>
    <p>Not kill'd, but terrified out of my senses.&mdash;Well, if ever I stop at this inn
    again&mdash;</p>
    <p>You remember, Madam, I was thrown into a sad fright by the hurry and confusion
    without.&mdash;I dropped my pen, and pulled the bell with greater violence.&mdash;No
    one came;&mdash;the noise increas'd.&mdash;Several people ran up and down by the door
    of my apartment.&mdash;I flew and double lock'd it.&mdash;But, good God! what were my
    terrors, when a voice cried out, She cannot be brought to life!&mdash;Is there no
    assistance at hand?&mdash;no surgeon near?&mdash;I rushed from my chamber, in the
    first emotions of surprize and compassion, to mix in a confused croud,
    <i>unknowing</i> and <i>unknown</i>.&mdash;I ventur'd no further than the passage.
    Judge my astonishment, to perceive there, and in a large room which open'd into it,
    fifty or sixty well dressed people of both sexes:&mdash;<i>Women</i>, some crying,
    some laughing:&mdash;<i>Men</i> swearing, stamping, and calling upon others to come
    down and end the dispute below.&mdash;I thought of nothing <i>now</i>, but how to
    retreat unobserv'd:&mdash;when a gentleman, in regimentals, ran so furiously up the
    stairs full against me, that I should have been instantly at the bottom, had not his
    extended arm prevented my flight.</p>
    <p>I did not stay to receive his apologies, but hastened to my chamber, and have not
    yet recovered my trembling.&mdash;Why did I leave it?&mdash;Why was I so
    inconsiderate?</p>
    <p>Another alarm!&mdash;Some one knocks at the door!&mdash;Will there be no end to my
    frights?</p>
    <p>If one's spirits are on the flutter, how every little circumstance increases our
    consternation!&mdash;When I heard the tapping at my door, instead of enquiring who
    was there, I got up and stood against it.</p>
    <p>Don't be afraid, <i>Mame</i>, said a voice without; it is only the chambermaid
    come with some drops and water.&mdash;With drops and water! replied I, letting her
    in&mdash;who sent you hither?</p>
    <p>Captain Risby, <i>Mame</i>, one of the officers:&mdash;he told me you was
    frighten'd.</p>
    <p>I am oblig'd to the gentleman;&mdash;but set down the drops, I do not want
    any.&mdash;Pray tell me what has occasioned this uproar in your house?</p>
    <p>To be sure, <i>Mame</i>, here has been a terrifying noise this night.&mdash;It
    don't use to be so;&mdash;but our <i>Town's</i> Gentlemen have such a dislike to
    <i>Officers</i>, I suppose there will be no peace while they are in town.&mdash;I
    never saw the Ladies dress'd so fine in my life; and had the Colonel happen'd to ask
    one of the <i>Alderman's</i> daughters to dance, all would have gone on well.</p>
    <p>You have an assembly then in the house?</p>
    <p>O yes, <i>Mame</i>, the assembly is always kept here.&mdash;And, as I was saying,
    the Colonel should have danced with one of our Alderman's daughters:&mdash;instead of
    that, he engag'd a daughter of Esquire Light, and introduced the Major and a
    <i>handsome Captain</i> to her two sisters.&mdash;Now, to be sure, this was enough to
    enrage the best Trade's-People in the place, who can give their <i>young Ladies</i>
    three times as much as Mr. Light can his daughters.</p>
    <p>I saw she was determin'd to finish her harangue, so did not attempt to interrupt
    her.</p>
    <p>One of us chambermaids, <i>Mame</i>, continued she, always assist the
    waiters;&mdash;it was my turn this evening; so, as I was stirring the fire in the
    card-room, I could hear the Ladies whisper their partners, if they let strangers
    stand above them, they might dance with whom they could get for the
    future.&mdash;They were busy about the matter when the Colonel enter'd with Miss
    Light, who though she is <i>very</i> handsome, <i>very</i> sensible, and all that, it
    did not become her to wear a silver silk;&mdash;for what, as <i>our Ladies</i> said,
    is family without fortune?&mdash;But I am running on with a story of an hour
    long.&mdash;So <i>Mame</i>, as soon as the Colonel and his partner went into the
    dancing-room,&mdash;<i>one</i> cry'd, Defend me from French'd hair, if people's heads
    are to look like towers;&mdash;<i>another</i>, her gown sleeves were too
    large;&mdash;a <i>third</i>, the robeings too high;&mdash;a <i>fourth</i>, her ruff
    too deep:&mdash;in short, <i>Mame</i>, her very shoe-buckles shared the same
    fate.</p>
    <p>This recital put me out of all patience:&mdash;I could not endure to see held up a
    picture, which, though out of the hands of a dauber, presented a true likeness of
    human nature in her most deprav'd state.&mdash;Enough, Mrs. Betty, said I, now pray
    warm my bed; it is late, and I am fatigued.</p>
    <p>O! to be sure, <i>Mame</i>; but will you not first hear what was the occasion of
    the noise?&mdash;The country-dances, continued she, not waiting my reply, began; and
    <i>our Town's Gentlemen</i> ran to the top of the room, leaving the <i>Officers</i>
    to dance at the bottom.&mdash;This put them in <i>so</i> violent a passion, that the
    Colonel swore, if <i>our</i> Gentlemen persisted in their ill manners, not a soul
    should dance.&mdash;So, <i>Mame</i>, upon this <i>our</i> Gentlemen let some of the
    Officers stand above them;&mdash;and there was no dispute till after ten.&mdash;What
    they quarrelled about then I don't know;&mdash;but, when I came into the room, they
    were all going to fight;&mdash;and fight they certainly would, if they could have got
    <i>our</i> Gentlemen down stairs.&mdash;Not one of them would stir, which made the
    others so mad, that they would have pulled them down, had not the Ladies
    interfered.&mdash;Then it was, <i>Mame</i>, I suppose, you heard the cries and
    shrieks; for every one that had <i>husbands, brothers</i>, or <i>admirers</i> there,
    took hold of them; begging and praying they would not fight.&mdash;Poor Miss Peggy
    Turner will have a fine rub; for she always deny'd to her <i>Mamma</i>, that there
    was any thing in the affair between her and Mr. Grant the Attorney. Now she has
    discovered all, by fainting away when he broke from her to go to the other end of the
    room.</p>
    <p>I hope there has been no blood shed?</p>
    <p>None, I'll assure you, <i>Mame</i>, in this house; what happens out of it is no
    business of mine. Now, <i>Mame</i>, would you please to go to bed? By all means, Mrs.
    Betty.&mdash;So away went my communicative companion. Being much tired, I shall lay
    down an hour or two, then reassume my pen.</p>
    <br />

    <p><i>Four o'clock in the morning</i>.</p>
    <p>Not able to close my eyes, I am got up to have the pleasure of introducing to your
    Ladyship the Gentleman who I mention'd was to dine with us at the other inn. Judge my
    surprize, when I found him to be the worthy Dean of H&mdash;&mdash; going into
    Oxfordshire to visit his former flock;&mdash;I knew him before Mr. Jenkings
    pronounced his name, by the strong likeness of his picture.</p>
    <p>I even fancied the beautiful pair stood before me, whose hands he is represented
    joining. It is much to be regretted so fine a piece should be hid from the
    world.&mdash;Why should not <i>this</i> be proportion? The <i>other</i> portraits
    which your Ladyship has drawn, are even allowed by Reynolds to be masterly.&mdash;Let
    me therefore entreat, next time he comes to the Lodge, my favourite may <i>at
    least</i> have a chance of being called from banishment.</p>
    <p>The Dean was almost discouraged from proceeding on his journey, by hearing of your
    Ladyship's absence, and the death of Mrs. Whitmore.&mdash;He was no stranger to what
    concern'd me, tho' I could be scarce an inhabitant of Hillford-Down at the time
    <i>he</i> left it.&mdash;I suppose his information was from Mr. Jenkings; I could see
    them from the window deep in discourse, walking in the Bowling-Green, from the moment
    the Dean got out of his chaise till dinner.</p>
    <p>The latter expressed infinite satisfaction when I joined them; looking with such
    stedfast tenderness, as if he would trace on my countenance the features of some dear
    friend.&mdash;His sincere regard for Mr. and Mrs. Whitmore, and the gratitude he owes
    your Ladyship, must make him behold me with a favourable eye, knowing how greatly I
    have been distinguish'd by the two latter.</p>
    <p>He had a stool put into his chaise; assuring us we could fit three
    conveniently&mdash;We came from the last inn together, and are to travel so the
    remainder of the journey.</p>
    <p>After your Ladyship's strict commands, that I look on Brandon-Lodge as my home, I
    shall make it such the few days I stay in Oxfordshire;&mdash;and have presumed on
    your indulgence, to request Mr. Jenkings will do the same.&mdash;The Dean's visit is
    to Mr. Gardener, which will be happy for me, as that Gentleman's house is so near the
    Lodge.&mdash;I hope to see the tops of the chimneys this evening.&mdash;</p>
    <p>My heart would jump at the sight, if I expected your Ladyship to meet me with open
    arms.&mdash;Extatic thought!&mdash;unfit to precede those disappointments which must
    follow thick on one another. Can there be greater!&mdash;to pass the very house, once
    inhabited by&mdash;O my Lady!&mdash;Heaven! how will your and her image bring before
    me past happy scenes!</p>
    <p>If this is the Dean's voice, he is got up, early. The horses putting to, and
    scarce five o'clock! Here comes a messenger, to say they are ready. So rest my pen,
    till; I again take it up at Brandon-Lodge.</p>
    <br />

    <p><i>Brandon-Lodge</i>.</p>
    <p>I never saw such general joy as appeared through the village at sight of the
    Dean.&mdash;The first person who espy'd him ran with such speed into every house,
    that by the time we reached Mr. Gardener's gate, the chaise was surrounded by a
    hundred people.&mdash;Mr. and Mrs. Gardener stepping out, were saluted by the Dean.
    What, our old friend! cried they.&mdash;What, our old friend!&mdash;Good
    God!&mdash;and Miss Warley too!&mdash;This is a joyful surprize, indeed! and would
    have taken me out by force, if I had not persisted in going to the Lodge.&mdash;Your
    Ladyship is enough acquainted with these good people, to know they would part with
    any thing rather than their friends.&mdash;I have not yet seen Miss Gardener: she was
    gone on a walk with Miss West and Miss Conway.</p>
    <p>The Dean showered a thousand marks of regard on all around him;&mdash;the meanest
    not escaping his notice.&mdash;In this tumult of pleasure I did not pass
    unregarded.&mdash;Your Ladyship and Mrs. Whitmore still live in their hearts; the
    pure air of Hillford-Down will not mix with the cold blast of ingratitude.</p>
    <p>May the soft pillow I am going to repose on, shut not out from my mind the load of
    obligations which rest on it!&mdash;The remembrance is balm to my soul, either in my
    sleeping or waking hours.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Nine o'clock.</p>
    <p>Scarce out of my bed half an hour!&mdash;How have I over-slept myself! Mrs. Bennet
    has prevailed on Mr. Jenkings to have some breakfast.&mdash;Good, considerate
    woman!&mdash;indeed, all your Ladyship's domestics are good and considerate.&mdash;No
    wonder, when you treat them so very different from <i>some people</i> of high rank.
    Let those who complain of fraud, guilt, negligence, or want of respect from their
    dependants, look in here;&mdash;where they will see honesty, virtue, and reverence
    attend the execution of every command.&mdash;Flowers must be planted before they can
    take root.&mdash;Few, very few endeavour to improve an uncultivated soil,
    notwithstanding how great the advantage is to the improver.</p>
    <p>I last night receiv'd pleasure inexpressible, by sending for the servants to
    acquaint them of your Ladyship's returning health; and feasted on the satisfaction
    they expressed.&mdash;In a moment all the live creatures were brought.&mdash;I am
    satisfied, my Lady, if any of them die in your absence, it must be of fat.&mdash;My
    old acquaintances Bell and Flora could hardly waddle in to pay their compliments; the
    parrot, which used to squall the moment she saw me, is now quite dumb; shewing no
    mark of her favour, but holding down her head to be scratched;&mdash;the turtle-doves
    are in the same case.&mdash;I have taken the liberty to desire the whole crew might
    be put to short allowance.</p>
    <p>John said, he believed it was natural for every thing to grow fat here; and was
    much afraid, when I saw the coach-horses, I should pronounce the same hard sentence
    against them, desiring orders to attend me with the carriage this morning.&mdash;I
    told him my stay would be so short, I should have no time for an airing.</p>
    <p>The gardener has just sent me a blooming nosegay; I suppose, to put me in mind of
    visiting his care, which I intend, after I have acquainted your Ladyship with an
    incident that till this moment had escaped my memory.&mdash;The Dean, Mr. Jenkings,
    and myself, were drinking a cup of chocolate before we sat out from the inn where I
    had been so much hurried, when captain Risby sent in his name, desiring we would
    admit him for a moment. His request being assented to, he entered very respectfully,
    said he came to apologize for the rudeness he was guilty of the last night.&mdash;The
    Dean and Mr. Jenkings presently guessed his meaning; I had been just relating the
    whole affair, which I was pleased to find did not disturb their rest.&mdash;I assured
    Captain Risby, far from deeming his behaviour rude, I was obliged to him for his
    solicitude in sending a servant to my chamber. He said he had not been in bed,
    determining to watch our setting out, in hopes his pardon would be sealed:&mdash;that
    to think of the accident he might have occasioned, gave him great pain.</p>
    <p>Pardon me, Madam, addressing himself to me; and you, Sir, to Mr. Jenkings; if I
    ask one plain question: Have <i>you</i>, or at least has not <i>that Lady</i>,
    relations out of England? I have a friend abroad&mdash;I have heard him say his
    father is still living;&mdash;but then he has no sister;&mdash;or a certain likeness
    I discover would convince me.</p>
    <p>Undoubtedly he took me for Mr. Jenkings's daughter:&mdash;what he meant further I
    cannot divine.</p>
    <p>Mr. Jenkings reply'd, You are mistaken, Sir, if you think me the father of this
    Lady.&mdash;The chaise driving up that moment to the door, he shook him by the hand,
    and led me towards it; the Captain assisting me in getting in.</p>
    <p>I wish I could have satisfied my curiosity.&mdash;I wish I had known to whom he
    likened me.&mdash;Perhaps his eyes misinformed him&mdash;perhaps he might have taken
    a cheerful glass after the last night's encounter:&mdash;yet he resembled not a
    votary of Bacchus;&mdash;his complexion clear;&mdash;hair nicely comb'd;&mdash;coat
    without a spot;&mdash;linen extremely fine and clean.&mdash;But enough of
    him.&mdash;Here comes the Dean, walking up the avenue escorting a party of my old
    acquaintances.</p>
    <p>Adieu! dearest honour'd Lady, till my return to Hampshire.</p>

    <h2>LETTER XIV.</h2>
    <p>The Honourable GEORGE MOLESWORTH to LORD DARCEY.</p>
    <p>London.</p>
    <br />

    <p><i>Was every any thing so forgetful, to bring no other clothes here but
    mourning?</i></p>
    <p>Really, my Lord, this favours a good deal of the matrimonial stile. Was you,
    commenced Benedict, I should think you had received lessons from the famous
    L&mdash;&mdash;, who takes such pains with his pupils, that those whose attendance is
    frequent, can, in, the space of three months after the knot is tied, bring their
    wives to hear patiently the
    words&mdash;<i>forgetful,&mdash;ridiculous,&mdash;absurd,&mdash;pish&mdash;poh</i>,&mdash;and
    a thousand more of the same significant meaning.&mdash;I hear you, my
    Lord:&mdash;<i>it is true</i>, I am in jest; and know you would scorn to say even a
    peevish thing to a wife.</p>
    <p>Why fret yourself to a skeleton about an absence of eight days?&mdash;How could
    you suppose she would let you go into Oxfordshire?&mdash;Proper decorums must be
    observed by that sex.&mdash;Are not those despicable who neglect them?&mdash;What
    would you have said, had she taken Edmund with her?&mdash;Don't storm:&mdash;on
    reflection you will find you had no greater right to expect that indulgence.</p>
    <p>I have this morning had a letter from Dick Risby, that unfortunate, but worthy
    cousin of <i>mine</i>, just returned from the West-Indies to take on him the command
    of a company in Lord &mdash;&mdash;'s regiment. What a Father his!&mdash;to abandon
    <i>such</i> a son.&mdash;Leave him to the wide world at sixteen,&mdash;without a
    shilling, only to gratify the pride and avarice of his serpent daughter,&mdash;who
    had art sufficient to get this noble youth disinherited for her waddling brat, whose
    head was form'd large enough to contain his mother's mischief and his own.&mdash;In
    vain we attempted to set aside the will:&mdash;my brother would not leave England
    whilst there remained the least hopes for poor Risby.</p>
    <p>I always dreaded Dick's going abroad, well knowing what a designing perfidious
    slut his sister was, from her very infancy.&mdash;Her parents drew down a curse by
    their blind indulgence:&mdash;even her nurse was charg'd not to contradict her; she
    was to have every thing for which she shewed the least inclination.</p>
    <p>Lord Eggom and myself being near of an age with our cousins, were sometimes sent
    to play with them in their nursery; and, though boys of tolerable spirit, that vixen
    girl has so worried us by her tyrannic and impatient temper, that we have often
    petitioned, at our return home, to be put to bed supperless.&mdash;If sweet-meats
    were to be divided, she would cry to have the whole; the same in regard to
    cards,&mdash;shells,&mdash;money, or whatever else was sent for our
    entertainment.&mdash;When she has pinched us black and blue,&mdash;a complaint to her
    mother has been made by Dick, who could not bear to see us so used, though he was
    obliged to take such treatment himself, the only redress we should receive
    was&mdash;Poh! she is but a baby.&mdash;I thought you had all known better than to
    take notice of what <i>such</i> a <i>child</i> as Lucy does&mdash;Once, when this was
    said before her, me flew at me, and cry'd, I will pinch again, if I
    please;&mdash;papa and mamma says I shall,&mdash;and so does nurse; and I don't mind
    what any body else says.&mdash;I waited only for my revenge, till the two former
    withdrew; when sending the latter for a glass of water, I gave <i>Miss</i> such a
    glorious tacking, as I believe she has never tasted the like before or
    since.&mdash;In the midst of the fray, I heard nurse running up, which made me hasten
    what I owed on <i>my own</i> account, to remind her of the <i>favours</i> she had
    conferred on Lord Eggom and her brother.&mdash;If such a termagant in her infant
    state,&mdash;judge what she must be at a time of life when her passions are in full
    vigour, and govern without controul!&mdash;I have just shewn the method of rearing
    this diabolical plant, that you may not wonder at its productions.&mdash;I shall see
    justice overtake her, notwithstanding the long strides she is making to escape.</p>
    <p>Dick will be in town with us most part of the winter:&mdash;I have wrote him to
    that purpose, and mention'd your name. He will rejoice to see you:&mdash;I have often
    heard him regret your acquaintance was of so short standing.&mdash;Bridgman set out
    for York the day before I arrived; his servants inform me he is not expected back
    this three weeks.</p>
    <p>I like our lodgings vastly; but more so as the master and mistress of the family
    are excessively clean and obliging; two things so material to my repose, that I
    absolutely could not dispense patiently with either.&mdash;This it was which made me
    felicitous about taking a house; I am now so happily situated, I wish not to have one
    in town whilst I remain a batchelor. Heaven knows how long that will be!&mdash;Your
    nonpareil has given me a dislike to all my former slight prepossessions.</p>
    <p>Lady Elizabeth Curtis!&mdash;I did once indeed think a little seriously of
    her:&mdash;but <i>such</i> a meer girl!&mdash;Perhaps the time she has spent in
    France, Germany, and the Lord knows where, may have changed her from a little
    bewitching, smiling, artless creature&mdash;to a <i>vain, designing,
    haughty</i>,&mdash;I could call a coquet by a thousand names;&mdash;but Lady
    Elizabeth <i>can</i>-not, <i>must</i> not be a coquet.&mdash;Cupid, though, shall
    never tye a bandage over my eyes.&mdash;The charms that must fix me are not to be
    borrow'd;&mdash;I shall look for them in her affection to her relations;&mdash;in a
    condescending behaviour to inferiors;&mdash;above all, when she offers up her first
    duties.&mdash;If she shines here, I shall not follow her to the card-table, or
    play-house:&mdash;every thing must be right in a heart where duty, affection, and
    humility, has the precedence.</p>
    <p>The misfortune of our sex is this: when taken with a fine face, we enquire no
    further than, Is she <i>polite?</i>&mdash;Is she <i>witty?</i> Does she <i>dance</i>
    well?&mdash;sing well?&mdash;in short, <i>is</i> she fit to appear in the <i>Beau
    Monde</i>; whilst good sense and virtues which constitute real happiness, are left
    out of the question.</p>
    <p>How does beauty,&mdash;politeness&mdash;wit,&mdash;a fine voice,&mdash;a graceful
    movement, charm!&mdash;But how often are we deceiv'd by them.&mdash;An instance of
    which I have lately seen in our old friend Sir Harry. No man on earth can pity that
    poor soul more than I do; yet I have laughed hours to think of his mistake. <i>So
    mild&mdash;so gentle</i>&mdash;said he, George, a week before his marriage, I should
    have said <i>execution</i>,&mdash;it is impossible to put her out of humour.&mdash;If
    I am not the happiest man breathing, it must be my own fault.</p>
    <p>What was my astonishment when I call'd on him in my way to town, and found this
    mild <i>gentle mate</i> of his, aided by a houseful of her relations, had not only
    deprived him of all right and authority in the <i>Castle</i>, but almost of his very
    speech!</p>
    <p>I dropt in about one, told the Baronet I came five miles out of my way for the
    pleasure of saluting his bride, and to drink a bottle of claret with him.&mdash;He
    was extremely glad to see me; and ventured to say so, <i>before</i> I was introduced
    to the <i>Ladies</i>:&mdash;but I saw by his sneaking look, no such liberty must be
    taken in <i>their</i> presence.&mdash;My reception was gracious enough, considering
    all communication is cut off between him and his former acquaintance.</p>
    <p>Scarce was I seated, before the old Dowager asked me, if her daughter had not made
    <i>great</i> alterations in the little time she had been at the Castle.</p>
    <p><i>Alterations</i>, Madam! I reply'd;&mdash;upon my honour, they are <i>so</i>
    visible, no person can avoid being struck with them.&mdash;How could your father and
    mother, Sir Harry, bear to live in such an wood? looking and speaking
    disdainfully.&mdash;He smiled obsequious&mdash;hemm'd&mdash;trembled, and was
    silent.&mdash;I hope, continued she, not to see a tree remaining near this house
    before the next summer.&mdash;We want much, Mr. Molesworth, turning to me with quite
    a different look and voice, to have the pleasure-ground laid out:&mdash;but really
    her Ladyship has had so much to set in order <i>within doors</i>, that it has taken
    off her attention a good deal from what is necessary to be done
    <i>without</i>.&mdash;However, Sir, you shall see our design; so, my dear, speaking
    to her daughter, let Sir Harry fetch the plan.</p>
    <p>It is in my closet, returned her Ladyship, and I don't chuse to send <i>him</i>
    there;&mdash;but I'll ring for Sally.</p>
    <p>I had like that moment to have vow'd a life of celibacy&mdash;I saw him
    redden;&mdash;how could he avoid it, if one spark of manhood remain'd?</p>
    <p>The indignation I felt threw such a mist before my eyes, that when the plan was
    laid on the table, I could scarce distinguish temples from clumps of shrubs, or
    Chinese seats from green slopes.&mdash;Yet this <i>reptile</i> of a husband could
    look over my shoulder, hear the opinion of every one present, without <i>daring</i>
    to give his own.</p>
    <p>I was more out of patience at dinner.&mdash;Bless me, says her Ladyship, how
    <i>aukward</i> you are when I <i>bid</i> you cut up any thing!&mdash;the mother and
    daughter echoing, <i>Never</i> was there <i>such</i> a carver as <i>Sir
    Harry!</i>&mdash;Well, I vow, cry'd the latter, it is a strange thing you will not
    remember, so often as I have <i>told you</i>, to lay the meat handsome in the
    dish.</p>
    <p>Good God! thought I, can this man live out half his days?&mdash;And, faith, if I
    had not drank five bumpers of Madeira, I could not have stood the sight of his
    fearful countenance.</p>
    <p>He perceived I was distress'd, and whisper'd me as I mounted my horse,&mdash;You
    see how it is, Molesworth; breeding women <i>must</i> not be contradicted.&mdash;</p>
    <p><i>I do, I do</i> see how it is, return'd I; and could not for my soul forbear
    saying, I shall rejoice to hear of a <i>delivery</i>.</p>
    <p>This is the day when the important affairs of the m&mdash;&mdash;y are to be
    settled; the papers will inform you; but can a man in love have any relish for
    politics?&mdash;Pray, divest yourself of that plague, when you attend the
    house.&mdash;I should drop to hear you say you espouse <i>this</i> or <i>that</i>
    cause, for the love of <i>Miss Warley</i>, instead of your <i>country</i>.</p>
    <p><i>Next Friday!</i>&mdash;Well, I long to see you after a dreadful, dreadful
    absence of <i>eight days</i>.&mdash;There is something confounded ridiculous in all
    this stuff; nor can I scarce credit that man should pine, fret, and make himself
    unhappy, because he is loosed from the apron-strings of his Phillida for a few
    days.&mdash;I see you shrug;&mdash;but my fate is not dependent on your
    prognostications.&mdash;Was it so, I know where I should be,&mdash;down amongst the
    <i>dead</i> men;&mdash;down amongst the <i>dead</i> men.&mdash;</p>
    <p>However, I would consent to be rank'd in the number of Cupid's slain, could I be
    hit by just such a dart as pierc'd you.</p>
    <p>Vulcan certainly has none ready made that will do, unless he sharpens the points
    of those which have already recoiled.</p>
    <p>But hold; I must descend from the clouds, to regale myself on a fine turtle at the
    Duke of R&mdash;&mdash;d's. What an <i>epicure!</i> Talk of feasting my palate, when
    my eyes are to meet delicacies of a far more inviting nature!&mdash;There <i>was</i>
    a time I should have been envy'd <i>such</i> a repast:&mdash;<i>that</i> time is
    fled;&mdash;<i>you</i> are no longer a monopolizer of beauty;&mdash;can sing but of
    <i>one</i>,&mdash;talk but of <i>one</i>&mdash;dream but of <i>one</i>,&mdash;and,
    what is still more extraordinary, love but <i>one</i>.&mdash;</p>

    <h2>LETTER XV.</h2>
    <p>Lord DARCEY to the Honourable GEORGE MOLESWORTH.</p>
    <p><i>Barford Abbey</i>.</p>
    <br />

    <p>I envy not the greatest monarch on earth!&mdash;She is return'd with my
    peace;&mdash;my joy;&mdash;my very soul.&mdash;Had you seen her restorative smiles!
    they spoke more than my pen can describe!&mdash;She bestow'd them on me, even before
    she ran to the arms of Sir James and Lady Powis.&mdash;Sweet condescension!&mdash;Her
    hand held out to meet mine, which, trembling, stopt half way.&mdash;What
    checks,&mdash;what restraint, did I inflict on myself!&mdash;Yes, that would have
    been the decisive moment, had I not perceiv'd the eyes of Argus planted <i>before,
    behind</i>, on <i>every side</i> of Sir James.&mdash;God! how he star'd.&mdash;I
    suppose my looks made some discovery.&mdash;Once more I must take thee up, uneasy
    dress of hypocrisy;&mdash;though it will be as hard to girt on, as the tight
    waistcoat on a lunatic.</p>
    <p>Never has a day appear'd to me so long as <i>this</i>.&mdash;<i>Full</i> of
    expectation, <i>full</i> of impatience!&mdash;All stuff again.&mdash;No matter; it is
    not the groans of a sick man, that can convey his pain to another:&mdash;to feel
    greatly, you must have been afflicted with the same malady.</p>
    <p>I suppose you would laugh to hear how often I have opened and shut the
    door;&mdash;how often look'd out at the window,&mdash;or the multiplicity of times
    examined my watch since ten this morning!&mdash;Needless would it likewise be to
    recount the impatient steps I have taken by the road-side, attentive to the false
    winds, which would frequently cheat me into a belief, that my heart's treasure was
    approaching.&mdash;Hark! I should say, that must be wheels;&mdash;stop and
    pause;&mdash;walk forwards;&mdash;stop again, till every sound have died upon my
    ear.</p>
    <p>Harrass'd by expectation, I saunter'd a back way to Jenkings's;&mdash;enquired of
    Mrs. Jenkings, what time she thought her husband might be home; and taking Edmund
    with me to my former walk, determined to sound <i>his</i> inclinations.&mdash;I waved
    mentioning Miss Warley's name till we had gone near a quarter of a mile from the
    house; still expecting he would begin the subject, which at this juncture I suppose
    particularly engaged his attention; but perceiving he led to things quite opposite, I
    drew him out in the following manner.</p>
    <p>So you really think, Edmund, your father will not be out after it is dark?</p>
    <p>I have not known, my Lord, that he has for many years; rather than venture, I
    believe, he would stop the night at Oxford. Very composedly he said this, for I
    watched his looks narrowly.&mdash;</p>
    <p>Edmund, confess, confess <i>frankly</i>, said I; has not <i>this</i> day been the
    longest you ever knew?</p>
    <p>The longest I ever knew! Faith your Lordship was never more out: far from thinking
    so, I am startled to find how fast the hours have flown; and want the addition of at
    least three, to answer letters which my father's business requires.</p>
    <p>Business, <i>Edmund!</i> and does <i>business</i> really engross so much of your
    attention, when you know <i>who</i> is expected in the evening? Ah! <i>Edmund</i>,
    you are a sly fellow: never tell me, you want to lengthen out the tedious hours of
    <i>absence</i>.</p>
    <p><i>Tedious hours of absence!</i> Ho! ho! my Lord, I see <i>now</i> what you are
    at; your Lordship can never suppose me <i>such</i> a fool as to&mdash;</p>
    <p>Fool!&mdash;My supposition, <i>Edmund</i>, pronounces you a man of sense; but you
    mistake my meaning.</p>
    <p>I do not mistake, my Lord; surely it must be the height of folly to lift my
    thoughts to Miss Warley. Suppose my father can give me a few thousands,&mdash;are
    these sufficient to purchase beauty, good sense, with every accomplishment?&mdash;No,
    no, my Lord, I am not such a vain fellow;&mdash;Miss Warley was never born for
    <i>Edmund Jenkings</i>&mdash;She told me <i>so</i>, the first moment I beheld
    her.</p>
    <p><i>Told you so?</i> what then, you have made pretensions to her, and she told you
    <i>so?</i></p>
    <p>Yes, my Lord, she told, me <i>so</i>.&mdash;That is, her <i>eyes</i>, her whole
    graceful <i>form</i>, spoke it.&mdash;Was I a man of family,&mdash;a man of title,
    with a proper knowledge of the world,&mdash;I would not deliberate a moment.</p>
    <p>How comes it then, Edmund, that you are so assiduous to oblige her?&mdash;You
    would not run and fly for every young lady.&mdash;</p>
    <p>True, my Lord, it is not every one would repay me with smiles of condescension.
    Suffer me to assure your Lordship, when I can oblige Miss Warley, my ambition is
    gratified.&mdash;Never, <i>never</i> shall a more presumptuous wish intrude to make
    me less worthy of the honour I receive from your Lordship's notice.&mdash;</p>
    <p>This he spoke with energy;&mdash;such energy,&mdash;as if he had come at the book
    of my heart, and was reading its contents. I knew his regard for my dear amiable
    girl, and the danger of betraying my secret, or should have treated him with
    unbounded confidence:&mdash;I therefore only applauded his sentiments;&mdash;told him
    a man who could think thus nobly,&mdash;honour'd me in his friendship;&mdash;that
    mine to him should be unalterable; call'd him brother; and by the joyful
    perturbations of my soul, I fear I gave him some idea of what I strove to hide.</p>
    <p>The curtain of night was dropping by slow degrees, when a distant sound of wheels
    interrupted our conversation.&mdash;We stood listening a moment, as it approach'd
    nearer. Edmund cry'd out,&mdash;They are come; I hear, Caesar's voice; and, taking a
    hearty leave, ran home to receive them.&mdash;I directed my course towards the Abbey,
    in hopes the chaise had proceeded thither, and found I had steer'd right, seeing it
    stand at the entrance.</p>
    <p>Mr. Jenkings did not get out; Lady Powis refused to part with Miss Warley this
    night. Whilst I write, I hope she is enjoying a sweet refreshing sleep. O!
    Molesworth! could I flatter myself she dreams of me!&mdash;</p>
    <p>To-morrow Lord and Lady Allen, Mr. and Mrs. Winter, dine here; consequently Miss
    Winter, and her <i>fond</i> admirer, Lord Baily.&mdash;How often have I laugh'd to
    see that cooing, billing, pair? It is come home, you'll say, with a
    vengeance.&mdash;Not so neither.&mdash;I never intend making such a very fool of
    myself as Lord Baily.&mdash;Pray, Madam, don't sit against that door;&mdash;and pray,
    Madam, don't sit against this window.&mdash;I hear you have encreased your
    cold;&mdash;you speak hoarse:&mdash;indeed, Madam, you speak hoarse, though you won't
    confess it.&mdash;In this strain has the monkey ran on for two hours.&mdash;No body
    must help him at table but Miss Winter.&mdash;He is always sure to eat whatever is
    next her.&mdash;She, equally complaisant, sends her plate to him;&mdash;desires he
    will have a bit of the same.&mdash;Excessively high, my Lord;&mdash;you never eat any
    thing so well done.&mdash;The appearance of fruit is generally the occasion of great
    altercation:&mdash;What! venture on peaches again, Miss Winter?&mdash;Indeed, my
    Lord, I shall only eat this small one;&mdash;that was not half ripe which made me
    sick yesterday.&mdash;No more nuts; I absolutely lay an embargo on nuts,&mdash;No
    more, nonsense: I absolutely lay an embargo on nonsense, says Molesworth to</p>

    <h2>LETTER XVI.</h2>
    <p>Miss WARLEY to Lady MARY SUTTON.</p>
    <p><i>Barford Abbey</i>.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Once more, my dear Lady, I dispatch a packet from this place,&mdash;after bidding
    adieu to the agreeable Dean,&mdash;Brandon Lodge,&mdash;and my friends in that
    neighbourhood.</p>
    <p>How long I shall continue here, God only knows.&mdash;If my wishes could avail,
    the time would be short; very short, indeed.&mdash;I am quite out of patience with
    Mr. and Mrs. Smith; some delay every time I hear from them.&mdash;First, we were to
    embark the middle of this month;&mdash;then the latter end;&mdash;now it is put off
    till the beginning of the next:&mdash;perhaps, when I hear next, it will be, they do
    not go at all.&mdash;Such weak resolutions are never to be depended on;&mdash;a
    straw, like a magnet, will draw them from side to side.</p>
    <p>I think I am as much an inhabitant of this house as of Mr. Jenkings's:&mdash;I lay
    here last night after my journey, and shall dine here this day; but as a great deal
    of company is expected, must go to my <i>other</i> home to dress.&mdash;To-morrow
    your Ladyship shall command me.</p>
    <br />

    <p>From Mr. <i>Jenkings's</i>.</p>
    <p>Rejoice with me, my dear Lady.&mdash;You <i>will</i> rejoice, I know, you
    <i>will</i>. to find my eyes are open to my folly.&mdash;How could I be so vain; so
    presumptuous!&mdash;Yes, it must be vanity, it must be presumption to the
    highest,&mdash;gloss it over as I will,&mdash;to harbour thoughts which before this
    your Ladyship is acquainted with.&mdash;Did you not blush for me?&mdash;did you not
    in contempt throw aside my letter?&mdash;Undoubtedly you did.&mdash;Go, you
    said.&mdash;I am sure, dear Madam, you <i>must</i> let me not again behold the
    weakness of that poor silly girl.&mdash;But this is my hope, you are not apt to judge
    unfavourably, <i>even</i> in circumstances that will scarce admit of
    palliation.&mdash;Tell me, my dear Lady, I am pardoned; tell me so, and I shall never
    be again unhappy.&mdash;How charming, to have <i>peace</i> and <i>tranquility</i>
    restor'd, when I fear'd they were for <i>ever</i> banish'd my breast!&mdash;I
    welcomed the friends;&mdash;my heart bounded at their return;&mdash;I smiled on
    them;&mdash;soothed them;&mdash;and promised never more to drive them out.</p>
    <p>Thank you, Lord Allen;&mdash;again, I thank you:&mdash;can I ever be too
    grateful?&mdash;You have been instrumental to my repose.</p>
    <p>The company that dined at the Abbey yesterday were Lord and Lady Allen, Lord
    Baily, Mr. Mrs. and Miss Winter.&mdash;This was the first day I changed my
    mourning;&mdash;a white lutestring, with the fine suit of rough garnets your Ladyship
    gave me, was my dress on the occasion.&mdash;But let me proceed to the incident for
    which I stand indebted for the secret tranquility, the innate repose I now possess in
    a <i>superlative</i> degree.&mdash;</p>
    <p>When I went to Mr. Jenkings's to dress for dinner, Lord Darcey attended me, as
    usual:&mdash;the coach was to fetch us.&mdash;I thought I never saw his Lordship in
    such high good humour; what I mean is, I never saw him in such spirits.&mdash;To
    speak the truth, his temper always appears unruffled;&mdash;sometimes a little
    gloomy; but I suppose he is not exempted from the common ills of life.&mdash;He
    entertained me on the way with a description of the company expected, interlarding
    his conversation with observations tending to raise my vanity. Notwithstanding his
    seeming sincerity, I was proof against such insinuations.&mdash;If he had stopp'd
    <i>there</i>,&mdash;well, if he had stop'd <i>there</i>;&mdash;what then?&mdash;Why
    then, perhaps, I should not have betray'd the weakness of my heart.&mdash;But I hope
    thy confusion pass'd unobserv'd;&mdash;I hope it was not seen before I could draw my
    handkerchief from my pocket: if it should, heavens! the very thought has dyed me
    scarlet.</p>
    <p>I am running on as though your Ladyship had been present in Mr. Jenkings's
    parlour,&mdash;in the coach,&mdash;and at table, whither I must conduct you, my dear
    Lady, if your patience will bear a minute <i>recital</i>.&mdash;First, then, to our
    conference in the parlour, after I was dress'd.</p>
    <p>My coming down interrupted a <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> between his
    Lordship and Edmund. The latter withdrew soon after I entered;&mdash;<i>it look'd
    some-how as if designed;&mdash;it vexed me</i>;&mdash;mean it how he would, <i>it
    much</i> disconcerted me:&mdash;I <i>hate</i>, I <i>despise</i> the least appearance
    of design.&mdash;In vain did I attempt to bring him back; he only answer'd he would
    be with us instantly.</p>
    <p>I was no sooner seated, than his Lordship placed himself by me; and fetching a
    deep sigh, said, I wish it was in my power to oblige Miss Warley as much as it is in
    hers to oblige me.&mdash;</p>
    <p>My Lord, I cannot conceive how I have it in my power to oblige you. He took my
    hand,&mdash;Yes, Madam, to make <i>me</i> happy,&mdash;for ever happy,&mdash;to make
    <i>Sir James</i> and <i>Lady Powis happy</i>, you have only to determine not to quit
    your native country.</p>
    <p>Stop! my Lord, if you mean my going to <i>Montpellier</i>, I am
    determin'd.&mdash;And are you <i>really</i> determin'd, Miss Warley?&mdash;his face
    overspread with a dreadful paleness.</p>
    <p>I am, my Lord,</p>
    <p>But what are you determin'd? Are you determined to distress your friends?</p>
    <p>I wish not to distress my friends: nothing would give me so much pain; but I
    <i>must</i> go;&mdash;indeed I <i>must</i>.</p>
    <p>He rose up;&mdash;walk'd about the room,&mdash;came back to his seat again,
    looking quite frantic,&mdash;Good God! why should that sex practise so many arts? He
    pray'd,&mdash;intreated,&mdash;left no argument untried.</p>
    <p>I cannot picture his countenance, when I declared myself resolved.&mdash;He caught
    both my hands, fixed his eyes stedfastly upon me.</p>
    <p>Then you are inflexible, Madam?&mdash;Nothing can move you to pity the most
    wretched of his sex.&mdash;Know you the person living that could prevail?&mdash;If
    you do,&mdash;say so;&mdash;I will bring him instantly on his knees.</p>
    <p>There is not in the world, my Lord, one who could prevent me from paying my
    <i>duty</i>, my <i>affection</i>, my <i>obedience</i>, to Lady Mary Sutton: if due to
    a parent, how much more from me to <i>Lady Mary</i>;&mdash;a poor orphan, who have
    experienced from her the most maternal fondness? The word <i>orphan</i> struck him;
    he reeled from me and flung himself into a chair opposite, leaning his head on a
    table which stood near.</p>
    <p>I declare he distress'd me greatly;&mdash;I know not what my thoughts were at that
    moment;&mdash;I rose to quit the room; he started up.</p>
    <p>Don't leave me, Miss Warley;&mdash;don't leave me. I <i>will</i> keep you no
    longer in the dark: I <i>must</i> not suffer in your opinion,&mdash;be the
    consequence&mdash;</p>
    <p>Here we were interrupted by Edmund.&mdash;I was sorry he just then
    entered;&mdash;I would have given the world to know what his Lordship was about to
    say.</p>
    <p>When we were in the coach, instead of explaining himself, he assumed rather a
    chearful air; and asked, if my time was fix'd for going to France?</p>
    <p>Not absolutely fix'd, my Lord; a month or two hence, perhaps. This I said, that he
    might not know exactly the time when I shall set out.</p>
    <p><i>A month</i> or <i>two!</i> O! that will be just the thing, just as I could wish
    it.&mdash;</p>
    <p>What does your Lordship mean?</p>
    <p>Only that I intend spending part of the winter in Paris; and if I should not be
    deemed an <i>intruder</i>, perhaps the same yacht may carry us over.</p>
    <p>I was never more at a loss for a reply.</p>
    <p>Going to France, my Lord! in a hesitating voice.&mdash;I never heard,&mdash;I
    never dreamt,&mdash;your Lordship had such an intention.</p>
    <p>Well, you do not forbid it, Miss Warley? I shall certainty be of your party:</p>
    <p><i>I forbid it</i>, my Lord! <i>I forbid it!</i> What right have <i>I</i> to
    controul your Lordship's actions? Besides, we should travel so short a way together,
    it would be very immaterial.</p>
    <p>Give me Leave, Madam, in this respect to be the judge; perhaps every one is not
    bless'd with that <i>happy</i> indifference.&mdash;What may be very <i>immaterial</i>
    to <i>one</i>,&mdash;may be matter of the <i>highest</i> importance to
    <i>another</i>.</p>
    <p>He pronounced the word <i>immaterial</i>, with some marks of displeasure. I was
    greatly embarrass'd: I thought our conversation would soon become too
    interesting.</p>
    <p>I knew not what to do.&mdash;I attempted to give it a different turn; yet it
    engrossed all my attention.&mdash;At length I succeeded by introducing my comical
    adventure at the inn, in our way to Oxfordshire: but the officer's name had escaped
    my memory, though I since recollect it to be Risby.</p>
    <p>This subject engaged us till we came within sight of the drawing-room
    windows.&mdash;There are the visitors, as I live! said I. Your Lordship not being
    dress'd, will, I suppose, order the coach to the other door.&mdash;To be plain, I was
    glad of any excuse that would prevent my getting out before them.&mdash;Not <i>I</i>,
    indeed, Miss Warley, reply'd he:&mdash;Dress is never of consequence enough to draw
    me two steps out of my way.&mdash;If the spectators yonder will fix their eyes on an
    old coat rather than a fine young Lady, <i>why</i> they have it for their pains.</p>
    <p>By this time the door was open'd, and Sir James appearing, led me, with his usual
    politeness, to the company. I was placed by her Ladyship next Miss Winter, whose
    person I cannot say prejudiced me in her favour, being entirely dispossessed of that
    winning grace which attracts strangers at a first glance.</p>
    <p>After measuring me with her eye from head to toe, she sent my dimensions in a kind
    of half smile across the room to Lord Baily; then vouchsafed to ask, how long I had
    been in this part of the world? which question was followed by fifty others, that
    shewed she laboured under the violent thirst of curiosity; a thirst never to be
    conquered; for, like dropsical people, the more they drink in, the more it rages.</p>
    <p>My answers were such as I always return to the inquisitive.&mdash;Yes,
    Madam;&mdash;No, Madam;&mdash;very well;&mdash;very good;&mdash;not
    certain;&mdash;quite undetermin'd.&mdash;Finding herself unsuccessful with <i>me</i>,
    she apply'd to <i>Lady Powis</i>; but alas! poor maiden, she could drain nothing from
    that fountain; the streams would not flow;&mdash;they were driven back, by
    endeavouring to force them into a wrong channel.</p>
    <p>These were not certainly her first defeats, by the clever way of hiding her
    chagrin:&mdash;it is gone whilst she adjusts the flower in her bosom,&mdash;or opens
    and shuts her fan twice.&mdash;How can <i>she</i> be mortified by trifles,&mdash;when
    the <i>Lord</i> of <i>her heart</i>,&mdash;the sweet, simpering, fair-faced, Lord
    Baily keeps his eyes incessantly fixed on her, like centinels on guard?&mdash;They
    cannot speak, <i>indeed they cannot</i>, or I should expect them to call out every
    half hour, "All is well."</p>
    <p>I admire Lord and Lady Allen. I say, I admire them: their manners are full of easy
    freedom, pleasing vivacity.&mdash;I cannot admire all the world; I wish I
    could.&mdash;Mr. and Mrs. Winter happen not to suit my taste;&mdash;they are a kind
    of people who look down on every one of middle fortune;&mdash;seem to despise
    ancestry,&mdash;yet are always fond of mixing with the great.&mdash;Their rise was
    too sudden;&mdash;they jump'd into life all at once.&mdash;Such quick transitions
    require great equality of mind;&mdash;the blaze of splendor was too much for their
    <i>weak</i> eyes;&mdash;the <i>flare</i> of surprise is still visible.</p>
    <p>It was some time before the conversation became general.&mdash;First, and ever to
    have precedence,&mdash;the weather;&mdash;next, roads;&mdash;then
    houses,&mdash;plantations,&mdash;fashions,&mdash;dress,&mdash;equipage;&mdash;and
    last of all, politics in a thread-bare coat.</p>
    <p>About ten minutes before dinner, Lord Darcey joined us, dress'd most magnificently
    in a suit of olive velvet, embroider'd with gold;&mdash;his hair without powder,
    which became him infinitely.&mdash;He certainly appear'd to great
    advantage:&mdash;how could it be otherwise, when in company with that tawdry, gilded
    piece of clay?&mdash;And to sit by him, of all things!&mdash;One would really think
    it had been designed:&mdash;<i>some</i> exulted, <i>some</i> look'd mortified at the
    contrast.&mdash;Poor Miss Winter's seat began to grow very uneasy;&mdash;she tried
    every corner, yet could not vary the light in which she saw the <i>two
    opposites</i>.&mdash;Why did she frown on <i>me?</i>&mdash;why cast such contemptuous
    glances every time I turn'd my eye towards her?&mdash;Did <i>I</i> recommend the
    daubed coxcomb;&mdash;or represent that her future joys depended on title?&mdash;No!
    it was vanity, the love of grandeur,&mdash;that could make her give up fine sense,
    fine accomplishments, a princely address, and all the noble requisites:&mdash;yes, my
    Lady, such a one, Lord Darcey tells me, she has refused.&mdash;Refused, for what? For
    folly, a total ignorance in the polite arts, and a meaness of manners not to be
    express'd: yet, I dare say, she thinks, the sweet sounds of <i>my Lady</i>, and
    <i>your Ladyship</i> is <i>cheaply</i> purchased by such a sacrifice.</p>
    <p>When we moved to go into the dining-parlour, Miss Winter bow'd for me to follow
    Lady Allen and her mother; which after I had declined, Lady Powis took me by the
    hand, and said, smiling, No, Madam, Miss Warley is one of us.&mdash;If <i>so</i>, my
    Lady&mdash;and she swam out of the room with an air I shall never forget.</p>
    <p>Lord Darcey took his place at table, next Lord Allen;&mdash;I sat opposite, with
    Miss Winter on my right, and Lord Baily on my left.&mdash;Sorry I was, to step
    between the Lovers; but ceremony required it; so I hope they do not hate me on that
    account.&mdash;Lord Allen has a good deal of archness in his countenance, though not
    of the ill-natur'd kind.&mdash;I don't know how, but every time he look'd across the
    table I trembled; it seem'd a foreboding of what was to follow.</p>
    <p>He admired the venison;&mdash;said it was the best he had ever tasted from Sir
    James's park;&mdash;but declared he would challenge him next Monday, if all present
    would favour him with their company.&mdash;Lady Allen seconded the request so warmly,
    that it was immediately assented to.&mdash;</p>
    <p>What think you, said his Lordship it is to the <i>young</i> folks that I address
    myself, of seeing before you a couple who that day has been married twenty years, and
    never frown'd on one another?</p>
    <p>Think! said Lord Darcey, it is very possible.</p>
    <p><i>Possible</i> it certainly is, reply'd Lady Powis; but very few instances, I
    believe&mdash;</p>
    <p>What say you, Miss Warley? ask'd his Lordship: you find Lord Darcey supposes it
    very possible.&mdash;Good God! I thought I should have sunk: it was not so much the
    question, as the manner he express'd it in. I felt as if my face was stuck full of
    needles: however, I stifled my confusion, and reply'd, I was quite of Lady Powis's
    opinion.</p>
    <p>Well, what say you, Miss Winter?</p>
    <p>How I rejoiced! I declare I could hardly contain my joy, when he address'd himself
    to her.</p>
    <p>What say I, my Lord? return'd she; why, <i>truly</i>, I think it must be your own
    faults, if you are not treated <i>civilly</i>.&mdash;The Devil! cry'd he.</p>
    <p>O fie! O fie! my Lord, squeaked my left hand neighbour.&mdash;And why O fie!
    retorted his Lordship: Is <i>civility</i> all we have to expect?</p>
    <p>We can <i>claim</i> nothing else said the squeaker.&mdash;If the dear creatures
    condescend to <i>esteem</i> us, we ought to consider it a particular indulgence.</p>
    <p>And so, Miss Warley, cry'd Lord Allen, we are only to be <i>esteemed</i>
    now-a-days. I thank God my good woman has imbibed none of those modern notions. Her
    actions have convinced the world of that long ago.</p>
    <p>Poh! my Lord, said Lady Allen, we are old-fashion'd people:&mdash;you must not
    talk thus before Gentlemen and Ladies bred in the present age.</p>
    <p>Come, come, let me hear Lord Darcey speak to this point, continued his Lordship.
    He is soon to be <i>one of us</i>;&mdash;we shall shortly, I am told, salute him
    <i>Benedick</i>.</p>
    <p>On this Sir James threw down his knife and fork with emotion, crying, This is
    news, indeed! This is what I never heard before! Upon my word, your Lordship has been
    very secret! looking full at Lord Darcey. But you are of <i>age</i>, my Lord, so I
    have no <i>right</i> to be consulted; however, I should be glad to know, who it is
    that runs away with your heart. This was spoke half in jest, half in earnest.</p>
    <p>In a moment my neck and face were all over crimson.&mdash;I felt the colour
    rise;&mdash;it was not to be suppress'd.&mdash;I drew my handkerchief from my
    pocket;&mdash;held it to my face;&mdash;hemm'd;&mdash;call'd for wine and
    water;&mdash;which, when brought, I could scarcely swallow; spoke in a low voice to
    Miss Winter;&mdash;said she had a poor stomach, or something like it.</p>
    <p>Lord Darcey too was confus'd.&mdash;Why did I look up to him?&mdash;He was pale,
    instead of red.&mdash;I saw his lips move, but could not hear what he said for more
    than a minute; occasion'd by an uncommon noise which just then rush'd through my
    head:&mdash;at length sounds grew distinct, and I heard this
    sentence&mdash;<i>every</i> word is inscribed where it can <i>never</i> be
    erazed&mdash;</p>
    <p>Upon my honour. Lord Allen, I have never made proposals to any woman; and
    <i>further</i>, it is a matter of doubt, whether I ever shall.</p>
    <p>By this time I had lost all my colour;&mdash;charming cool&mdash;and
    calm,&mdash;no perturbation remaining.</p>
    <p>Nothing disagreeable now hung on my mind, except a certain thoughtfulness,
    occasion'd by the recollection of my folly.&mdash;</p>
    <p>Miss Winter's eyes sparkled, if it is possible for grey ones to sparkle, at the
    declaration Lord Darcey had just made; and, of a sudden, growing very fond of
    <i>me</i>, laid her hand on mine, speaking as it were aside,&mdash;Well, I was never
    <i>more</i> surprized! I as <i>much</i> believed him engaged to a <i>certain</i>
    young Lady,&mdash;squeezing my thumb,&mdash;as I think I am living.&mdash;Nay, I
    would not have credited the contrary, had I not heard him declare off with my
    <i>own</i> ears.&mdash;I see how it is; Sir James must chuse a wife for
    him.&mdash;</p>
    <p>To all which I only answered, Lord Darcey, Madam, is certainly the best judge of
    his actions:&mdash;I make no doubt but Sir James will approve his Lordship's
    choice.</p>
    <p>After what I have related, common subjects ensued:&mdash;the cloth being removed,
    I withdrew to the Library, intending to sit with Mr. Watson half an hour, who was
    confined by a cold. He holds out his hand to take mine the moment he hears my
    footstep.&mdash;I look on him as an angel: his purity, his mildness, his resignation
    speak him one.&mdash;</p>
    <p>Lord Darcey entered as I was about to join the company; however, I staid some
    minutes, that my quitting the room might not seem on <i>his</i> account.</p>
    <p>I am glad you are come, my Lord, said Mr. Watson; sitting with such a poor infirm
    man has made Miss Warley thoughtful.&mdash;Upon my word, Sir, returned I, it was only
    the fear of increasing your head-ach that me silent.&mdash;I never was in higher
    spirits.&mdash;I could sing and dance this very moment. Well then, dear Miss Warley,
    cried his Lordship, let me fetch your <i>guitarre</i>.</p>
    <p>With all my heart, my Lord; I am <i>quite</i> in tune.&mdash;Taking leave of Mr.
    Watson, I return'd to the company.&mdash;His Lordship soon followed. Again repeating
    his request, in which every person join'd, I sung and play'd several
    compositions.</p>
    <p>Miss Winter was next call'd upon and the guitarre presented to her by Lord
    Darcey.&mdash;A long time she absolutely refused it; declaring she had not learnt any
    new music this year.&mdash;What does that signify, Miss Winter? said her mother; you
    know you have a sweet voice.</p>
    <p>Bless me! Madam! how can you say so?&mdash;To be sure, I should sing to great
    advantage <i>now</i>.</p>
    <p>Well, Nancy, you'll oblige <i>Papa?</i>&mdash;says the old Gentleman; I know
    you'll oblige <i>Papa</i>,&mdash;stalking over to her on the tops of his toes.</p>
    <p>Here the contest ended; <i>Miss</i> taking the guitarre, condescended to oblige
    her <i>Papa</i>.</p>
    <p>She really sings and plays well:&mdash;if her manner had been less affected, we
    should have been more entertain'd.&mdash;The company staid supper, after which Lord
    Darcey came with me home.&mdash;I made <i>no</i> objection:&mdash;of all things, I
    would make <i>none</i>&mdash;after what pass'd at table. Fortunate event! how I
    rejoice in my recovered tranquillity!</p>
    <p>The thoughts, the pleasing thoughts of freedom have kept me from sleep; I could
    not think of repose amidst my charming reflections. Happy, happy change!</p>
    <p>It is past two o'clock!&mdash;At all times and all seasons,</p>
    <p>I am, my dear Lady,</p>
    <p>Yours invariably,</p>

    immediately.&mdash;I go, my dear Lady; soon as I return will acquaint you what has
    occasion'd me this <i>early</i> summons.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Eight o'clock at Night.</p>
    <p>No ill news! quite the reverse:&mdash;I am escaped from the house of festivity to
    make your Ladyship a partaker.</p>
    <p>My spirits are in a flutter.&mdash;I know not where to begin.&mdash;I have run
    every step of the way, till I am quite out of breath.&mdash;Mr. Powis is coming
    home,&mdash;absolutely coming home to settle;&mdash;married <i>too</i>, but I cannot
    tell all at once.&mdash;Letters with an account of it have been this morning
    receiv'd. He does not say <i>who</i> his wife is, only one of the best women in the
    world.</p>
    <p>She will be received with affection;&mdash;I know she will.&mdash;Lady Powis
    declares, they shall be folded together in her arms.</p>
    <p>It was too much for Sir James, he quite roared again when he held out to me the
    letter,&mdash;I don't believe he has eat a morsel this day.&mdash;I never before saw
    a man so affected with joy.&mdash;Thank God! I left him pure and calm.</p>
    <p>The servants were like mad creatures, particularly those who lived in the family
    before Mr. Powis left England.&mdash;He seems, in short, to be considered as one
    risen from the dead.&mdash;</p>
    <p>I was in such haste on receiving Lady Powis's message, that I ran down to the
    coach, my hat and cloak in my hand.&mdash;Mr. and Mrs. Jenkings were talking to the
    coachman.&mdash;I soon perceived by them something pleasing had happen'd.&mdash;They
    caught me in their arms, and I thought would have smother'd me in their embraces;
    crying out, Mr. Powis is coming home, my dear;&mdash;Mr. Powis is coming
    home:&mdash;for God's sake, Madam, make haste up to the Hall.</p>
    <p>In getting into the coach, I stepp'd on my apron, and fell against the opposite
    door.&mdash;My right arm was greatly bruis'd, which I did not perceive till I drew on
    my glove.</p>
    <p>The moment I alighted, I ran to the breakfast-parlour; but finding no one there,
    went directly to her Ladyship's dressing-room.&mdash;She open'd the door, when she
    heard me coming. I flew to her.&mdash;I threw my arms about her neck, and all I could
    say in my hurry was, Joy, Joy, Joy!</p>
    <p>I am all joy, my love, she return'd&mdash;I am made up of nothing else. I quitted
    her to run to Sir James, who was sitting in a great chair with a letter held out. I
    believe I kiss'd him twenty times before I took it;&mdash;there could be no harm in
    that surely.&mdash;Such endearments I should have shewn my father, on the like tender
    occasion. He wept, as I have said, till he quite roared again.&mdash;I laid his head
    on my shoulder, and it was some time before I would mention his son's name.</p>
    <p>Lord Darcey held one of Sir James's hands: he was in the room when I enter'd; but
    I declare I never saw him till he spoke. He is safe <i>now</i>,&mdash;after what
    happened yesterday,&mdash;safe from any imputation on <i>my</i> account&mdash;</p>
    <p>Very kind and very civil, upon my word! O! your Ladyship never heard such a fuss
    as he made about the scratch on my arm.&mdash;I affect to look pleased when he speaks
    to me, that he might not take it into his head I am mortified.</p>
    <p>He must be the happiest creature in the world; I honour him for the grateful
    affection he shews Sir James and Lady Powis.</p>
    <p>Breakfast stood on the table: not a soul had broke their fast.&mdash;Her Ladyship
    was here, there, and every where.&mdash;I was sadly afraid they would be all sick; at
    length I prevailed on them to drink a cup of chocolate.&mdash;</p>
    <p>Mr. Watson, good man notwithstanding his indisposition, got up at eleven.&mdash;I
    met him coming from his apartment, and had the pleasure of leading him to the happy
    family.&mdash;</p>
    <p>His congratulations were delivered with such serene joy,&mdash;such warmth of
    affection,&mdash;as if he had cull'd the heart-felt satisfaction of both
    <i>parents</i>.</p>
    <p>The word <i>happy</i> echoed from every mouth; each sentence began and ended with
    it.&mdash;What the heart feels is seldom to be disguised.&mdash;Grief will
    speak,&mdash;if not by the tongue, it will out;&mdash;it hangs on the features,
    sallows the skin, withers the sinews, and is a galling weight that pulls towards the
    ground.&mdash;Why should a thought of grief intrude at this time?&mdash;Is not my
    dear Lady Mary's health returning?&mdash;Is not felicity restor'd to this
    family?&mdash;Now will my regret at parting be lessened;&mdash;now shall I leave
    every individual with minds perfectly at ease.</p>
    <p>Mr. Powis is expected in less than a month, intending to embark in the next ship
    after the Packet.&mdash;How I long to see him!&mdash;But it is very unlikely I
    should; I shall certainly have taken my leave of this place before he
    arrives.&mdash;By your Ladyship's permission, I hope to look in upon them, at our
    return to England.</p>
    <p>What genteel freedoms men give themselves after <i>declaring off</i>, as Miss
    Winter calls it?&mdash;I had never so many fine things said to me before;&mdash;I
    can't tell how many;&mdash;quite a superabundance;&mdash;and before Sir James
    <i>too!</i>&mdash;But no notice is taken; he has cleared himself of all
    suspicion.&mdash;He may go to town as soon as he will.&mdash;His business is
    done;&mdash;yes, he did it yesterday.</p>
    <p>I wish I may not laugh out in the midst of his fine speeches.&mdash;</p>
    <p>I wish your Ladyship could see this cool attention I give him.&mdash;But I have
    nettled him to the truth this afternoon:&mdash;his pride was alarm'd;&mdash;it could
    certainly proceed from <i>no other</i> cause, after he has <i>declared off</i>.</p>
    <p>I was sitting at the tea-table, a trouble I always take from Lady Powis, who with
    Sir James was walking just without the windows, when Lord Darcey open'd the door, and
    said, advancing towards me with affected airs of admiration,&mdash;How proud should I
    be to see my house and table so graced!&mdash;Then leaning over the back of my chair,
    Well, my angel! how is the bad arm? Come, let me see, attempting to draw off my
    glove.</p>
    <p>Oh! quite well, my Lord; withdrawing my hand carelessly.</p>
    <p>For heaven's sake, take more care of yourself, Miss Warley; this might have been a
    sad affair.</p>
    <p>Depend on that, my Lord, for my own sake.</p>
    <p>For your <i>own sake!</i> Not in consideration of any <i>other</i> person?</p>
    <p>Yes; of <i>Lady Mary Sutton, Sir James</i> and <i>Lady Powis, good Mr.
    Jenkings</i> and <i>his wife</i>, who I know would be concerned was I to suffer much
    from any accident.</p>
    <p>Then there is no <i>other</i> person you would wish to preserve your life for?</p>
    <p>Not that I know at present, my Lord,</p>
    <p>Not that you know at <i>present!</i> so you think you may one day or
    <i>other?</i></p>
    <p>I pretend not, my Lord, to answer for what <i>may</i> happen; I have never seen
    the <i>person</i> yet. I was going to say something further, I have really forgot
    what, when he turn'd from me, and walked up and down the room with a seeming
    discomposure.</p>
    <p><i>If</i> you are sincere in what you have said, <i>Miss Warley</i>; <i>if</i> you
    are <i>really</i> sincere, I do pronounce&mdash;Here he burst open the door, and flew
    out the instant Sir James and Lady Powis entered.</p>
    <p>When the tea was made, a footman was sent to Lord Darcey; but he was no where to
    be found.</p>
    <p>This is very strange, said her Ladyship; Lord Darcey never used to be out of the
    way at tea-time. I declare I am quite uneasy; perhaps he may be ill.</p>
    <p>Oh! cry'd Sir James, don't hurry yourself; I warrant he is got into one of his old
    reveries, and forgets the time.</p>
    <p>I was quite easy. I knew his abrupt departure was nothing but an air:&mdash;an air
    of consequence, I suppose.&mdash;However, I was willing to be convinced, so did not
    move till I saw the Gentleman sauntering up the lawn. As no one perceived him but
    myself, I slid out to the housekeeper, and told her, if her Lady enquir'd for me, I
    was gone home to write Letters by to-morrow's post.</p>
    <p>You have enough of it now, I believe, my dear Lady; two long letters by the same
    packet:&mdash;but you are the repository of my joy, my grief, the very inmost secrets
    of my soul.&mdash;You, my dear Lady, have the whole heart of</p>

    <h2>LETTER XVIII.</h2>
    <p>Lord DARCEY to the Honourable GEORGE MOLESWORTH.</p>
    <p><i>Barford Abbey</i>.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Ruin'd and undone, as I hope for mercy!&mdash;undone too by my own egregious
    folly!&mdash;She is quite lost,&mdash;quite out of my power.&mdash;I wish Lord Allen
    had been in the bottom of the sea;&mdash;he can never make me amends;&mdash;no, if he
    was to die to-morrow and leave me his whole fortune.&mdash;</p>
    <p>I told you he was to dine here yesterday.&mdash;I cannot be
    circumstantial.&mdash;He did dine here;&mdash;to my utter sorrow he did.</p>
    <p>Oh what a charming morning I spent!&mdash;Tho' my angel persisted in going to
    France, yet it was in a manner that made me love her, if possible, ten thousand times
    more than ever.&mdash;Good God! had you seen how she look'd!&mdash;But no matter
    now;&mdash;I must forget her angelical sweetness.&mdash;Forget did I say?&mdash;No,
    by heaven and earth&mdash;she lives in every corner of my heart.&mdash;I wish I had
    told her my whole soul.&mdash;I was going to tell her, if I had not been
    interrupted.&mdash;It is too late now.&mdash;She would not hear me: I see by her
    manners she would not hear me. She has learnt to look with indifference:&mdash;even
    smiles with indifference.&mdash;Why does she not frown? That would be joy to what her
    smiles afford.&mdash;I hate such smiles; they are darts dipp'd in poison.&mdash;</p>
    <p>Lord Allen said he heard I was going to be marry'd:&mdash;<i>What was that to
    him?</i>&mdash;Sir James look'd displeased. To quiet <i>his</i> fears I assured
    him&mdash;God! I know not what I assured <i>him</i>&mdash;something very foreign from
    my heart.</p>
    <p>She blushed when Sir James asked, to whom?&mdash;With what raptures did I behold
    her blushes!&mdash;But she shrunk at my answer.&mdash;I saw the colour leave her
    cheek, like a rose-bud fading beneath the hoary frost.</p>
    <p>I <i>will</i> know my fate.&mdash;Twill be with you in a few days,&mdash;if Sir
    James should consent.&mdash;<i>What if he should consent?</i>&mdash;She is steeled
    against my vows&mdash;my protestations;&mdash;my words affect her not;&mdash;the most
    tender assiduities are disregarded:&mdash;she seems to attend to what I say, yet
    regards it not.</p>
    <p>Where are those looks of preference fled,&mdash;those expressive looks?&mdash;I
    saw them not till now:&mdash;it is their loss,&mdash;it is their sad reverse that
    tells me what they were. She turns not her head to follow my foot-steps at
    parting;&mdash;or when I return, does not proclaim it by advancing pleasure tip-toe
    to the windows of her soul.&mdash;No anxiety for my health! No, she cares not what
    becomes of me.&mdash;I complain'd of my head, said I was in great pain;&mdash;heaven
    knows how true! My complaints were disregarded.&mdash;I attended her home. She sung
    all the way; or if she talked, it was of music:&mdash;not a word of <i>my poor
    head</i>;&mdash;no charges to draw the glasses up going back.</p>
    <p>There was a time, Molesworth&mdash;there was a time, if my finger had but ached,
    it was, My Lord, you look ill. Does not Lady Powis persuade you to have advice? You
    are really too careless of your health.</p>
    <p>Shall she be <i>another's?</i>&mdash;Yes; when I shrink at sight of what lies
    yonder,&mdash;my sword, George;&mdash;that shall prevent her ever being
    <i>another's</i>.</p>
    <p>Tell me you believe she will be <i>mine</i>:&mdash;it may help to calm my
    disturbed mind.&mdash;Be sure you do not hint she will be <i>another's</i>.</p>
    <p>Have I told you, Mr. Powis is coming home?&mdash;I cannot recollect whether I have
    or not;&mdash;neither can I pain myself to look back.</p>
    <p>All the world has something to comfort them, but your poor friend.&mdash;Every
    thing wears the face of joy, till I turn my eyes inwards:&mdash;<i>there it is</i> I
    behold the opposite;&mdash;<i>there it is</i> where Grief has fix'd her
    abode.&mdash;Does the fiend ever sleep? Will she be composed by ushering in the happy
    prospects of others?&mdash;Yes, I will feel, joy.&mdash;Joy did I say? Joy I cannot
    feel.&mdash;Satisfaction then?&mdash;Satisfaction likewise is forbid to
    enter.&mdash;What then will possess my mind; on recollecting peace is restor'd, where
    gratitude calls for such large returns?&mdash;I'll pray for them;&mdash;I'll pray for
    a continuance of their felicity.&mdash;I'll pray, if they have future ills in store,
    they may light on the head of Darcey.&mdash;Yes, he can bear more yet:&mdash;let the
    load be ever so heavy, he will stoop to take up the burthen of his
    friends;&mdash;such friends as Sir James and Lady Powis have been to</p>

    <h2>LETTER XIX.</h2>
    <p>The Honourable GEORGE MOLESWORTH to LORD DARCEY.</p>
    <p>London.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Well, give me the first salute of your fair bride;&mdash;<i>and for your bride</i>
    I'll ensure Miss Warley.&mdash;Why there is not a symptom but is in your
    favour.&mdash;She is nettled; can't you perceive it?&mdash;Once a studied disregard
    takes place, we are safe:&mdash;nothing will hurt you <i>now</i>, my Lord.&mdash;</p>
    <p>You have been stuttering falsehoods.&mdash;From what I can gather, you have been
    hushing the Baronet at the expence of your own and Miss Warley's quiet.&mdash;If you
    have, never mind it; things may not be the worse.&mdash;Come away, I advise you; set
    out immediately.&mdash;See how she looks at parting.&mdash;But don't distress
    her;&mdash;I charge you not to distress her.&mdash;Should you play back her own
    cards, I will not answer for the pride of the sex.&mdash;</p>
    <p>Sir James's consent once gained, and she rejects your proposals, lay all your
    letters to me on the subject before her.&mdash;I have them by me.&mdash;These cannot
    fail of clearing every doubt; she will be convinced then how sincerely you have loved
    her.&mdash;</p>
    <p>You surprise me concerning Mr. Powis:&mdash;I thought he was settled in his
    government for life;&mdash;or rather, for the life of his father.&mdash;However, I am
    convinced his coming over will be no bad thing for you;&mdash;he has suffered too
    much from avarice, not to assist another so hardly beset.&mdash;</p>
    <p>Was not his settling abroad an odd affair!&mdash;If he determined to remain single
    till he had an opportunity of pleasing himself, why did he leave England?&mdash;The
    mortification could not be great to have his overtures refused, where they were made
    with such indifference.&mdash;</p>
    <p>As he has lived so many years a batchelor, I suppose there will be now an end to
    that great family.&mdash;</p>
    <p>What a leveller is avarice! How does it pull down by attempting to raise? How
    miserable, as Seneca says, in the desire?&mdash;how miserable in attaining our
    ends?&mdash;The same great man alledges, that as long as we are solicitous for the
    increase of wealth, we lose the true use of it; and spend our time in putting out,
    calling in, and passing our accounts, without any substantial benefit, either to the
    world, or to ourselves.&mdash;</p>
    <p>If you had ever any uneasiness on Bridgman's account, it must be now at an
    end.&mdash;Married, and has brought his bride to town.&mdash;What a false
    fellow!&mdash;From undoubted authority, I am assured the writings have been drawn six
    months:&mdash;so that every thing must be concluded between him and his wife, at the
    very time he talked to me of Miss Warley.&mdash;I wash my hands from any further
    acquaintance with concealed minds:&mdash;there must be something very bad in a heart
    which has a dark cloud drawn before it.&mdash;Virtue and innocence need no
    curtain:&mdash;they were sent to us naked;&mdash;it is their loss, or never
    possessing them,&mdash;that makes caution necessary, to hide from the world their
    destined place of abode.&mdash;Without entering a house, and being conversant with
    its inhabitants, how is it possible to say, if they are worthy or unworthy:&mdash;so
    if you knock, and are not admitted, you still remain doubtful.&mdash;But I am grown
    wise from experience;&mdash;and shall judge, for the future, where a heart is closely
    shut up, there is nothing in it worth enquiring after.</p>
    <p>I go on Thursday to meet Risby, and conduct him to town. It would give us great
    joy, at our return, to shake you by the hand.&mdash;What can avail your staying
    longer in the midst of doubts, perplexities, racks, tortures, and I know-not-what.
    Have you any more terms to express the deadly disorder?&mdash;If you have keep them
    to yourself; I want not the confounded list compleat:&mdash;no; no, not I;
    faith.&mdash;</p>
    <p>I go this evening to see the new play, which is at present a general subject of
    conversation.&mdash;Now, was I a vain fellow&mdash;a boaster&mdash;would I mention
    four or six of the prettiest women about town, and swear I was to escort
    them.&mdash;Being a lover of truth, I confess I shall steal alone into an upper box,
    to fix my attention on the performance of the piece.&mdash;Perhaps, after all is
    over, I may step to the box of some sprightly, chatty girl, such as lady
    &mdash;&mdash;,&mdash;hear all the scandal of the town, ask her opinion of the play,
    hand her to her chair, and so home, to spend a snug evening with sir Edward Ganges,
    who has promised to meet me here at ten.</p>

    <h2>LETTER XX.</h2>
    <p>Lady MARY SUTTON to Miss WARLEY.</p>
    <p><i>German Spaw</i>.</p>
    <br />

    <p>No, my dear, <i>Lord Darcey</i> is not the man he appears.&mdash;What signifies a
    specious outside, if within there's a narrow heart?&mdash;Such must be his, to let a
    virtuous love sit imprisoned in secret corners, when it delights to dwell in open
    day.</p>
    <p>Perhaps, if he knew my intentions, all concealments would be thrown aside, and he
    glory to declare what at present he meanly darkly hints.&mdash;By my consent, you
    should never give your hand to one who can hold the treasures of the mind in such low
    estimation.</p>
    <p>When you mention'd your happy situation, the friendly treatment of Sir James and
    Lady Powis, I was inclined to think for <i>many</i> reasons, it would be wrong to
    take you from them;&mdash;<i>now</i> I am convinced, the pain <i>that</i> must
    occasion, or the danger in crossing the sea, is not to be compared to what you might
    suffer in your <i>peace</i> by remaining where you are.&mdash;When people of Lord
    Darcey's rank weigh long a matter of this nature, it is seldom the scale turns of the
    right side;&mdash;therefore, let not <i>Hope</i>, my dear child, flatter you out of
    your affections.</p>
    <p>Do not think you rest in security:&mdash;tender insinuations from a man such as
    you describe Lord Darcey, may hurt your quiet.</p>
    <p>I speak not from experience;&mdash;Nature, by cloathing me in her plainest garb,
    has put all these hopes and fears far from me.</p>
    <p>I have been ask'd, it is true, often, for my fortune;&mdash;at least, I look upon
    asking for my heart to be the same thing.&mdash;Sure, I could never be such a fool to
    part with the latter, when I well knew it was requested only to be put in possession
    of the former!</p>
    <p><i>You</i> think Jenkings suspects his son has a <i>too</i> tender regard for
    you;&mdash;<i>you</i> think he is uneasy on that account.&mdash;Perhaps he is
    uneasy;&mdash;but time will convince you his suspicions, his uneasiness, proceed not
    from the <i>cause you imagine</i>.&mdash;He is a good man; you cannot think too well
    of him.</p>
    <p>I hope this letter will find you safe return'd to Hampshire. I am preparing to
    leave the Spaw with all possible expedition: I should quit it with reluctance, but
    for the prospect of visiting it again next summer, with my dear Fanny.</p>
    <p>At Montpelier the winter will slide on imperceptibly: many agreeable families will
    there join us from the Spaw, whose good-humour and chearful dispositions, together
    with plentiful draughts of the Pouhon Spring, have almost made me forget the last ten
    years I have dragg'd, on in painful sickness.</p>
    <p>The family in which I have found most satisfaction, is Lord
    Hampstead's:&mdash;every way calculated to make themselves and others
    happy;&mdash;such harmony is observed through the whole, that the mechanism of the
    individuals seem to be kept in order by one common wheel.&mdash;I rejoice that I
    shall have an opportunity of introducing you to them.&mdash;We have fixed to set out
    the same day for Montpelier.</p>
    <p>Lady Elizabeth, the eldest daughter, has obligingly offer'd to travel in my coach,
    saying, she thought it would be dull for me to go alone.</p>
    <p>It is impossible to say which of the two sisters, was it left to my choice, would
    be my companion, as both are superlatively pleasing.&mdash;They possess, to a degree,
    what I so much admire in our sex;&mdash;a peculiar softness in the voice and manner;
    yet not quite so sprightly, perhaps, as may be thought necessary for some misses
    started up in this age; but sufficient, I think, for those who keep within certain
    bounds.&mdash;It requires an uncommon share of understanding, join'd with a great
    share of wit, to make a very lively disposition agreeable. I allow, if these two
    ingredients are happily blended, none can chuse but admire, as well as be entertain'd
    with, such natural fine talents:&mdash;on the contrary, where one sees a pert bold
    girl apeing such rare gifts, it is not only the most painful, but most absurd sight
    on earth.</p>
    <p>Lady Elizabeth, and her amiable sister Sophia strive to hide every perfection they
    possess;&mdash;yet these I have just mention'd, with all others, will on proper
    occasions, make their appearance through a croud of blushes.&mdash;This timidity
    proceeds partly from nature,&mdash;partly from the education they have received under
    the best of mothers, whose tenderness for them would not suffer her to assign that
    momentous task to any but herself; fearing, as she has often told me, they would have
    had a thousand faults overlook'd by another, which her eye was ever on the watch to
    discover. She well knew the most trivial might be to them of the worst
    consequence:&mdash;when they were call'd to an account for what was pass'd, or warn'd
    how to avoid the like for the future, her manner was so determin'd and persuasive, as
    if she was examining her own conscience, to rectify every spot and blemish in it.</p>
    <p>Though Lady Hampstead's fondness for her daughters must cause her to admire their
    good qualities, like a fine piece of perspective, whose beauties grow upon the
    eye,&mdash;yet she has the art not only to conceal her admiration, but, by the
    ascendency her tenderness has gain'd, she keeps even from themselves a knowledge of
    those perfections.&mdash;To this is owing the humility which has fortified their
    minds from the frequent attacks flattery makes against the unstable bulwarks of title
    and beauty.</p>
    <p>Matchless as these sisters appear, they are to be equalled in their own, as well
    as the other sex.&mdash;I hope you will allow it in <i>one</i>, when you see Lord
    Hallum: he is their brother as much by <i>virtue</i> as <i>birth</i>.&mdash;I could
    find in my heart to say a thousand things of this fine youth;&mdash;but that I think
    such subjects flow easier from a handsome young woman than a plain old one.&mdash;Yet
    don't be surpriz'd;&mdash;unaccountable things happen every day;&mdash;if I
    <i>should</i> lend a favourable ear to this Adonis!&mdash;Something whispers me I
    shall receive his proposals.&mdash;An excuse, on these occasions, is never wanting;
    mine will be a good one:&mdash;that, at my death, you may be left to the protection
    of this worthy Lord.&mdash;But, first, I must be assured you approve of him in that
    light;&mdash;being so firmly attach'd to my dear Fanny, to your happiness, my Love,
    that the wish of contributing to it is the warmest of your ever affectionate</p>

    <h2>LETTER XXI.</h2>
    <p>Lord DARCEY to the Hon. GEORGE MOLESWORTH.</p>
    <p><i>Barford Alley</i>.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Five days more, and I am with you.&mdash;Saturday morning!&mdash;Oh that I may
    support the hour of trial with fortitude!&mdash;I tremble at the thought;&mdash;my
    blood freezes in my veins, when I behold the object I am to part from.&mdash;</p>
    <p>I try in vain to keep out of her sight:&mdash;if I attempt to leave the room where
    she is, my resolutions are baffled before I reach the door.&mdash;Why do I endeavour
    to inflict so hard a penance!&mdash;Because I foolishly suppose it would wean
    me.&mdash;Wean me <i>from what?</i>&mdash;From virtue.&mdash;No, Molesworth, it is
    not <i>absence</i>;&mdash;it is not <i>time</i> itself can deaden the exalted
    image;&mdash;it neither sickens or dies, it blooms to immortality,</p>
    <p>Was I only to be parted from beauty, <i>that</i> I might meet again in every town
    and village.&mdash;I want you to force me from the house.&mdash;Suppose I get up
    early, and slip away without taking leave.&mdash;But that will not do;&mdash;Sir
    James is ceremonious;&mdash;Lady Powis may deem it disrespect;&mdash;above all, Miss
    Warley, <i>that dear, dear Miss Warley</i>,&mdash;if <i>she</i> should think me
    wanting in regard, all then must be at an end.</p>
    <p>Ha! Sir James yonder on the terrace, and alone! Let me examine his
    countenance:&mdash;I see no clouds;&mdash;this is the time, if ever!&mdash;Miss
    Warley not yet come up from Jenkings's!&mdash;If successful, with what transports
    shall I run to fetch her!&mdash;<i>Yes, I will</i> venture;&mdash;<i>I will</i> have
    one trial, as I hope for mercy.&mdash;</p>
    <hr style='width: 45%;' />
    <p><i>As I hope for mercy</i>, I see, were my last words.&mdash;I do indeed hope for
    it, but never from Sir James.</p>
    <p>Still perplexed;&mdash;still miserable!&mdash;</p>
    <p>I told you Miss Warley was not come from Jenkings's; but how I started, when I saw
    her going to Lady Powis's dressing-room!</p>
    <p>I was hurried about her in a dream, last night.&mdash;I thought I had lost
    her:&mdash;I hinted it when we met;&mdash;that moment I fancied she eyed me with
    regard;&mdash;she spoke <i>too</i> in a manner very different from what she has done
    some days past.&mdash;Then I'll swear it,&mdash;for it was not illusion,
    George,&mdash;her whole face had something of a sweet melancholy spread over
    it;&mdash;a kind of resignation in her look;&mdash;a melting softness that droop'd on
    her cheek:&mdash;I felt what it expressed;&mdash;it fir'd my whole frame;&mdash;it
    sent me to Sir James with redoubled eagerness.</p>
    <p>I found him thoughtful and complaisant: we took several turns, before I could
    introduce my intended subject; when, talking of my setting out, I said, Now I have an
    opportunity, Sir James, perhaps I may not have another before I go, I should be glad
    of your sentiments in regard to my settling in life.&mdash;</p>
    <p>How do you mean, my Lord; as to the choice of a wife?&mdash;</p>
    <p>Why, I think, Sir, there's no other way of settling to one's satisfaction.</p>
    <p>To be sure, it is very necessary your Lordship should consider on those
    matters,&mdash;especially as you are the last of a noble family:&mdash;when, you do
    fix, I hope it will be <i>prudently</i>.</p>
    <p><i>Prudently</i>, Sir James! you may depend on it I will never settle my
    affections <i>imprudently</i>.</p>
    <p>Wall, but, my Lord, what are your notions of <i>prudence?</i></p>
    <p>Why, Sir, to make choice of a person who is virtuous, sensible, well
    descended.&mdash;<i>Well descended Jenkings has assured me she is</i>.</p>
    <p>You say nothing, my Lord, of what is <i>most</i> essential to
    happiness;&mdash;nothing of the <i>main point</i>.</p>
    <p>Good-nature, I suppose you mean:&mdash;I would not marry an ill-natur'd woman, Sir
    James, for the world. And is good-nature, with those you have mention'd, the only
    requisites?</p>
    <p>I think they are the chief, Sir.</p>
    <p>You and I differ much, my Lord.&mdash;Your father left his estate encumbered; it
    is not yet clear; you are of age, my Lord: pray, spare yourself the trouble of
    consulting me, if you do not think of <i>fortune</i>.</p>
    <p>Duty to the memory of my rever'd father, the affection and gratitude I owe you,
    Sir James, calls for my obedience:&mdash;without <i>your</i> sanction, Sir, never
    shall my hand be given.</p>
    <p>He seem'd pleas'd: I saw tears starting to his eyes; but still he was resolv'd to
    distress me.</p>
    <p>Look about you, my child; look about you, Darcey;&mdash;there's Lady Jane Marshly,
    Miss Beaden, or&mdash;and was going on.</p>
    <p>Pardon me, Sir James, for interrupting you; but really, I cannot take any Lady on
    recommendation: I am very difficult, perhaps <i>perverse</i> in this point; my first
    attachment must be merely accidental.</p>
    <p>Ah! these are the notions that ruin half the young fellows of this
    age.&mdash;<i>Accidental likings</i>&mdash;<i>First love</i>,&mdash;and the devil
    knows what, runs away with half the old family estates.&mdash;Why, the least thing
    men ought to expect, even if they marry for <i>love</i>, is six-pence for a
    shilling.&mdash;Once for all, my Lord, I must tell you, your <i>interest</i> is to be
    consulted before your <i>inclinations</i>.</p>
    <p><i>Don't</i> be ruffled, Sir James; <i>don't</i> let us talk warmly of a matter
    which perhaps is at a great distance.</p>
    <p>I wish it may be at a <i>great distance</i>, my Lord.&mdash;<i>If what I
    conjecture is true</i>&mdash;Here he paus'd, and look'd so sternly, that I expected
    all would out.</p>
    <p>What do you <i>conjecture</i>, Sir?&mdash;Yes, I ask'd him what.&mdash;</p>
    <p>Your Lordship must excuse my answering that question. <i>I hope</i> I am
    wrong;&mdash;<i>I hope</i> such a thing never enter'd your thoughts:&mdash;if it
    has&mdash;and he mutter'd something I could not understand; only I heard distinctly
    the words <i>unlucky</i>,&mdash;<i>imprudent</i>,&mdash;<i>unforeseen</i>.&mdash;I
    knew enough of their meaning to silence me.&mdash;Shaking him by the hand, I said,
    Well, Sir James, if you please, we will drop this subject for the present.&mdash;On
    which the conversation ended.</p>
    <p>What a deal of patience and philosophy am I master of, to be here at my pen,
    whilst two old men are sucking in the honey which I should lay up for a winter's
    store?&mdash;Like Time, nothing can stand before her:&mdash;she mows down all
    ages.&mdash;Even Morgan, that man who us'd to look on a fine woman with more
    indifference than a horse or dog,&mdash;is now new-moulded;&mdash;not one oath in the
    space where I have known twenty escape him:&mdash;instead of following his dogs the
    whole morning, he is eternally with the ladies.</p>
    <p>If he rides out with my angel, for he's determin'd, he says, to make her a
    complete horsewoman, I must not presume to give the least direction, or <i>even</i>
    touch the bridle.</p>
    <p>I honour him for the tender regard he shews her:&mdash;yes, I go further;
    <i>he</i> and <i>Mr. Watson</i> may <i>love</i> her;&mdash;they do <i>love</i> her,
    and glory in declaring it.&mdash;I <i>love</i> them in return;&mdash;but they are the
    only two, of all the race of batchelors within my knowledge, that should make
    <i>such</i> a declaration with impunity.</p>
    <p>Let me see: I shall be in London Saturday evening;&mdash;Sunday, no
    post;&mdash;Monday, <i>then</i> I determine to write to Sir James;&mdash;Wednesday, I
    may have an answer;&mdash;<i>Thursday</i>,&mdash;who knows but
    <i>Thursday!</i>&mdash;nothing is impossible; who knows but <i>Thursday</i> I may
    return to all my hopes?&mdash;How much I resemble a shuttlecock! how am I thrown from
    side to side by hope and fear; now up, now down; no sooner mounted by one hand than
    lower'd by another!</p>
    <p>This moment a gleam of comfort steals sweetly through my heart;&mdash;but it is
    gone even before I could bid it welcome.&mdash;Why so fast!&mdash;to what spot is it
    fled?&mdash;Can there be a wretch more in need, who calls louder for its charitable
    ray than</p>

    <h2>LETTER XXII.</h2>
    <p>Miss WARLEY to Lady MARY SUTTON</p>
    <p><i>From Mr. Jenkings's</i></p>
    <br />

    <p>Now, my dear Lady, the time is absolutely fix'd for our embarkation; the 22d,
    without fail.&mdash;Mr. Smith intends coming himself, to accompany me to
    London.&mdash;How very good and obliging this!&mdash;I shall say nothing of it to
    Lady Powis, till Lord Darcey is gone, which will be Saturday:&mdash;<i>he</i> may go
    to France, if he pleases, but not with <i>me</i>.&mdash;</p>
    <p>When I received Mrs. Smith's letter, he was mighty curious to know who it was
    from:&mdash;I found him examining the seal, as it lay on the table in Mr. Jenkings's
    parlour.&mdash;Here is a letter for you, Miss Warley, a good deal confus'd.&mdash;So
    I see, my Lord: I suppose from Lady Mary Sutton.</p>
    <p>I fancy not;&mdash;it does not appear to be directed in the same hand with that my
    servant brought you last from the post-office.&mdash;I broke the seal; it was easy to
    perceive the contents gave me pleasure.</p>
    <p>There is something, Miss Warley, which gives you particular satisfaction.</p>
    <p>You are right, my Lord, I never was better pleas'd.</p>
    <p>Then it is from Lady Mary?</p>
    <p><i>No</i>, not from Lady Mary.</p>
    <p>From Mrs. Smith, <i>then?</i>&mdash;Do I guess <i>now?</i>&mdash;You say nothing;
    oh, there it is.&mdash;I could not forbear smiling.</p>
    <p>Pray tell me, only <i>tell me</i>, and he caught one of my hands, if this letter
    does not fix the <i>very</i> day of your setting out for France?</p>
    <p>I thought him possest with the spirit of divination.&mdash;What could I do, in
    this case?&mdash;Falshoods I despise;&mdash;evasions are low, <i>very</i> low,
    indeed:&mdash;yet I knew he ought not to be trusted with the contents, even at the
    expence of my veracity&mdash;I recollected myself, and looked grave.</p>
    <p>My Lord, you must excuse me; this affair concerns only myself; even Lady Powis
    will not be acquainted with it yet.</p>
    <p>I have done, if Lady Powis is not to be acquainted with it.&mdash;I have no
    right&mdash;I say <i>right</i>.&mdash;Don't look so, Miss Warley&mdash;<i>believe I
    did flare a little</i>&mdash;Time will unfold,&mdash;will cast a different light on
    things from that in which you now see them.</p>
    <p>I was confus'd;&mdash;I put up my letter, went to the window, took a book from
    thence, and open'd it, without knowing what I did.</p>
    <p><i>Complete Pocket-Farrier; or, A Cure for all Disorders in Horses</i>, read his
    Lordship aloud, looking over my shoulder; for such was the title of the book.</p>
    <p>What have you here, my love?</p>
    <p><i>My love</i>, indeed! Mighty free, mighty free, was it not, my Lady? I could not
    avoid laughing at the drollery of this accident, or I should have given him the look
    he deserved.&mdash;I thank God I am come to a state of <i>indifference</i>; and my
    time here is so short, I would willingly appear as little reserv'd as possible, that
    he might not think I have chang'd my sentiments since his <i>declaring off</i>:
    though I must own I have; but my pride will not suffer me to betray it to him.</p>
    <p>If he has distress'd me,&mdash;if he has led my heart a little astray,&mdash;I am
    recovered now:&mdash;I have found out my mistake.&mdash;Should I suffer my eye to
    drop a tear, on looking back, for the future it will be more watchful;&mdash;it will
    guard, it will protect the poor wanderer.</p>
    <p>He is very busy settling his affairs with Sir James:&mdash;three hours were they
    together with Mr. Jenkings in the library;&mdash;his books all pack'd up and sent
    away, to be sure he does not intend returning <i>here</i> again soon.</p>
    <p>I suppose he will settle;&mdash;he talks of new furnishing his house;&mdash;has
    consulted Lady Powis upon it.&mdash;If he did not intend marrying, if he had no Lady
    in his eye&mdash;</p>
    <p>But what is all this to me? Can he or his house be of any consequence to my
    repose?&mdash;I enjoy the thoughts of going to France without him:&mdash;I suppose he
    will think me very sly, but no matter.&mdash;</p>
    <p>That good-natur'd creature Edmund would match me to a prince, was it in his
    power.&mdash;He told me, yesterday, that he'd give the whole world, if I was not to
    go to France.&mdash;Why so, Edmund?&mdash;I shall see you again, said I, at my return
    to England.</p>
    <p>Ay, but what will <i>somebody do</i>, in the mean time?</p>
    <p>Who is <i>somebody?</i></p>
    <p>Can't you guess, Miss Warley?</p>
    <p>I do guess, Edmund. But you was never more mistaken; the person you mean is not to
    be distress'd by <i>my</i> absence.</p>
    <p>He is, upon my honour;&mdash;I know <i>he is</i>.&mdash;Lord Darcey loves you to
    distraction.</p>
    <p>Poh! Edmund; don't take such things into your head: I know <i>you</i> wish me
    well; but don't be so sanguine!&mdash;Lord Darcey stoop to think of <i>me!</i></p>
    <p>Stoop to think of <i>you</i>, Miss Warley!&mdash;I am out of all patience: stoop
    to think of <i>you!</i>&mdash;I shall never forget <i>that</i>.&mdash;Greatly as I
    honour his Lordship, if he conceals his sentiments, if he trifles in an affair of
    such importance,&mdash;was he the first duke in the kingdom, I hold him below the
    regard even of such a one as <i>I</i> am.&mdash;Pardon my curiosity, madam, I mean no
    ill; but surely he has made proposals to you.</p>
    <p>Well, then, I will tell you, Edmund;&mdash;I'll tell you frankly, he never
    <i>has</i> made proposals:&mdash;and further, I can answer for him, he never
    <i>will</i>.&mdash;His belief was stagger'd;&mdash;he stood still, his eyes fixed on
    the ground.</p>
    <p>Are you <i>really</i> in earnest, Miss Warley?</p>
    <p>Really, Edmund.</p>
    <p>Then, for heaven's sake, go to France.&mdash;But how can you tell, madam, he never
    intends to make proposals?</p>
    <p>On which I related what passed at table, the day Lord Allen dined at the
    Abbey.&mdash;Nothing could equal his astonishment; yet would he fain have persuaded
    me that I did not understand him;&mdash;call'd it misapprehension, and I know not
    what.</p>
    <p>He <i>will</i> offer you his hand, Miss Warley; he certainly
    <i>will</i>.&mdash;I've known him from a school-boy;&mdash;I'm acquainted with every
    turn of his mind;&mdash;I know his very looks;&mdash;I have observ'd them when they
    have been directed to you:&mdash;he will, I repeat,&mdash;he will offer you his
    hand.</p>
    <p>No! Edmund:&mdash;but if he <i>did</i>, his overtures should be disregarded.</p>
    <p>Say not so, Miss Warley; for God's sake, say not so again;&mdash;it kills me to
    think you <i>hate</i> Lord Darcey.</p>
    <p>I speak to you, Edmund, as a friend, as a brother:&mdash;never let what has pass'd
    escape your lips.</p>
    <p>If I do, madam, what must I deserve?&mdash;To be shut out from your confidence is
    a punishment only fit for such a breach of trust.&mdash;But, for heaven's sake, do
    not <i>hate</i> Lord Darcey.</p>
    <p>Mr. Jenkings appeared at this juncture, and look'd displeas'd.&mdash;How strangely
    are we given to mistakes!&mdash;I betray'd the same confusion, as if I had been
    really carrying on a clandestine affair with his son.&mdash;In a very angry tone he
    said, I thought, Edmund, you was to assist me, knowing how much I had on my hands,
    before Lord Darcey sets out;&mdash;but I find business is not <i>your</i>
    pursuit:&mdash;I believe I must consent to your going into the army, after
    all.&mdash;On which he button'd up his coat, and went towards the Abbey, leaving me
    quite thunderstruck. Poor Edmund was as much chagrined as myself.&mdash;A moment
    after I saw Mr. Jenkings returning with a countenance very different,&mdash;and
    taking me apart from his son, said, I cannot forgive myself, my dear young
    Lady;&mdash;can you forgive me for the rudeness I have just committed?&mdash;I am an
    old man, Miss Warley;&mdash;I have many things to perplex me;&mdash;I should
    not,&mdash;I know I should <i>not</i>, have spoke so sharply to Edmund, when you had
    honour'd him with your company.</p>
    <p>I made him easy by my answer; and since I have not seen a cloud on his
    brow.&mdash;I shall never think more, with concern, of Mr. Jenkings's
    suspicions.&mdash;Your Ladyship's last letter,&mdash;oh! how sweetly tender! tells me
    <i>he</i> has <i>motives</i> to which <i>I</i> am a stranger.</p>
    <p>We spent a charming day, last Monday, at Lord Allen's. Most of the neighbouring
    families were met there, to commemorate the happy festival.&mdash;Mr. Morgan made one
    of the party, and return'd with us to the Abbey, where he proposes waiting the
    arrival of his godson, Mr. Powis.&mdash;If I have any penetration, most of his
    fortune will center <i>there</i>,&mdash;For my part, I am not a little proud of
    stealing into his good graces:&mdash;I don't know for what, but Lady Powis tells me,
    I am one of his first favourites; he has presented me a pretty little grey horse,
    beautifully caparison'd; and hopes he says, to make me a good horsewoman.</p>
    <p>As I have promis'd to be at the Abbey early, I shall close this letter; and, if I
    have an opportunity, will write another by the same packet.&mdash;Believe me ever, my
    dearest Lady, your most grateful and affectionate</p>

    <p>Miss WARLEY to Lady MARY SUTTON.</p>
    <p><i>from Mr. Jenkings's</i>.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Oh what a designing man is Lord Darcey!&mdash;He loves me not, yet fain would
    persuade me that he does.&mdash;When I went yesterday morning to the Abbey, I met him
    in my way to Lady Powis's dressing-room.&mdash;Starting as if he had seen an
    apparition, and with a look which express'd great importance, he said, taking my
    hand, Oh! Miss Warley, I have had the most dreadful night!&mdash;but I hope
    <i>you</i> have rested well.</p>
    <p>I have rested very well, my Lord; what has disturb'd your Lordship's rest?</p>
    <p><i>What</i>, had it been <i>real</i> as it was <i>visionary</i>, would have drove
    me to madness.&mdash;I dreamt, Miss Warley,&mdash;I dreamt every thing I was
    possess'd of was torn from me;&mdash;but now&mdash;<i>and here stopt</i>.</p>
    <p>Well, my Lord, and did not the pleasure of being undeceiv'd overpay all the pain
    which you had been deceiv'd into?</p>
    <p>No, my angel!&mdash;<i>Why does he call me his angel?</i></p>
    <p>Why, no: I have such a sinking, such a load on my mind, to reflect it is
    possible,&mdash;only possible it might happen, that, upon my word, it has been almost
    too much for me.</p>
    <p>Ah! my Lord, you are certainly wrong to anticipate evils; they come fast enough,
    one need not run to meet them:&mdash;besides, if your Lordship had been in reality
    that very unfortunate creature, you dreamt you were, for no rank or degree is proof
    against the caprice of Fortune,&mdash;was nothing to be preserv'd
    entire?&mdash;Fortune can require only what she gave: fortitude, peace, and
    resignation, are not her gifts.</p>
    <p>Oh! Miss Warley, you mistake: it was not riches I fancied myself dispossess'd
    of;&mdash;it was, oh my God!&mdash;what my peace, my <i>very</i> soul is center'd
    in!&mdash;and his eyes turn'd round with so wild a stare, that really I began to
    suspect his head.</p>
    <p>I trembled so I could scarce reach the dressing-room, though just at the
    door.&mdash;The moment I turn'd from him, he flew like lightning over the stairs; and
    soon after, I saw him walking with Sir James on the terrace. By their gestures I
    could discover their conversation was not a common one.</p>
    <p>Mr. Morgan comes this instant in sight;&mdash;a servant after him, leading my
    little horse.&mdash;I am sorry to break off, but I must attend him;&mdash;he is so
    good, I know your Ladyship would be displeas'd, was I to prolong my letter at the
    expence of his favour.&mdash;Yours, my much honour'd,&mdash;my much lov'd
    Lady,&mdash;with all gratitude, with all affection,</p>

    <p>Miss WARLEY to the same.</p>
    <p><i>From Mr. Jenkings's</i>.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Now, my dearest Lady, am I again perplex'd, doubting, and embarrass'd:&mdash;yet
    Lord Darcey is gone,&mdash;gone this very morning,&mdash;about an hour since.</p>
    <p>Well, I did not think it would evermore be in his power to distress me;&mdash;but
    I have been distress'd,&mdash;greatly distress'd!&mdash;I begin to think Lord Darcey
    sincere,&mdash;that he has always been sincere&mdash;He talks of next
    <i>Thursday</i>, as a day to unravel great mysteries:&mdash;but I shall be far enough
    by that time; sail'd, perhaps.&mdash;Likely, he said, I might know before
    Thursday.&mdash;I wish any body could, tell me:&mdash;I fancy Sir James and Lady
    Powis are in the secret.</p>
    <p>Mr. Jenkings is gone with his Lordship to Mr. Stapleton's,&mdash;about ten miles
    this side London, on business of importance:&mdash;to-morrow he returns; then I shall
    acquaint him with my leaving this place.&mdash;Your Ladyship knows the motive why I
    have hitherto kept the day of my setting out a secret from every person,&mdash;even
    from Sir James and Lady Powis.</p>
    <p>Yesterday, the day preceding the departure of Lord Darcey, I went up to the Abbey,
    determin'd to exert my spirits and appear chearful, cost what it would to a poor
    disappointed heavy heart.&mdash;Yes, it was disappointed:&mdash;but till then I never
    rightly understood its situation;&mdash;or perhaps would not understand
    it;&mdash;else I have not examin'd it so closely as I ought, of late;&mdash;Not an
    unusual thing neither: we often stop to enquire, what fine feat
    <i>that?</i>&mdash;whose magnificent equipage <i>this?</i>&mdash;long to see and
    converse with persons so surrounded with splendor;&mdash;but if one happen to pass a
    poor dark cottage, and see the owner leaning on a crutch at the door, we are apt to
    go by, without making any enquiry, or betraying a wish to be acquainted with its
    misery.&mdash;</p>
    <p>This was my situation, when I directed my steps to the Abbey.&mdash;I saw not Lord
    Darcey in an hour after I came into the house;&mdash;when he join'd us, he was
    dress'd for the day, and in one hand his own hat, in the other mine, with my cloak,
    which he had pick'd up in the Vestibule:&mdash;he was dreadfully
    pale;&mdash;complain'd of a pain in his head, which he is very subject to;&mdash;said
    he wanted a walk;&mdash;and ask'd, if I would give him the honour of my
    company.&mdash;I had not the heart to refuse, when I saw how ill he
    look'd;&mdash;though for some days past, I have avoided being alone with him as much
    as possible.</p>
    <p>We met Lady Powis returning from a visit to her poultry-yard.&mdash;Where are my
    two runabouts going <i>now?</i> she said.&mdash;Only for a little walk, madam,
    reply'd Lord Darcey.</p>
    <p>You are a sauce-box, said she, shaking him by the hand;&mdash;but don't go, my
    Lord, <i>too far</i> with Miss Warley, nodding and smiling on him at the same
    time.&mdash;She gave me a sweet affectionate kiss, as I pass'd her; and cried out,
    You are a couple of pretty strollers, are you not!&mdash;But away together; only I
    charge you, my Lord, calling after him, remember you are not to go <i>too far</i>
    with my dear girl.</p>
    <p>We directed our steps towards the walk that leads to the Hermitage, neither of us
    seeming in harmony of spirits.&mdash;His Lordship still complaining of his head, I
    propos'd going back before we had gone ten paces from the house.</p>
    <p>Would Miss Warley then prevent me, said he, from the last satisfaction! might ever
    enjoy?&mdash;You don't know, madam, how long&mdash;it is impossible to say how
    long&mdash;if ever I should be so happy again&mdash;I look forward to Wednesday with
    impatience;&mdash;if that should be propitious,&mdash;<i>Thursday</i> will unravel
    <i>mysteries</i>; it will clear up <i>doubts</i>;&mdash;it will perhaps bring on an
    event which you, my dearest life, may in time reflect on with pleasure;&mdash;you, my
    dearest life!&mdash;pardon the liberty,&mdash;by heaven! I am sincere!</p>
    <p>I was going to withdraw my hand from his: I can be less reserv'd when he is less
    free.</p>
    <p>Don't take your hand from me;&mdash;I will call you miss Warley;&mdash;I see my
    freedom is depleasing;&mdash;but don't take your hand away; for I was still
    endeavouring to get it away from him.</p>
    <p>Yes, my angel, I will call you <i>Miss Warley</i>.</p>
    <p>Talk not at this rate, my Lord: it is a kind of conversation I do not, nor wish to
    understand.</p>
    <p>I see, madam, I am to be unhappy;&mdash;I know you have great reason to condemn
    me:&mdash;my whole behaviour, since I first saw you, has been one riddle.</p>
    <p>Pray, my Lord, forbear this subject.</p>
    <p>No! if I never see you more, Miss Warley,&mdash;this is my wish that you think the
    worst of me that appearances admit;&mdash;think I have basely wish'd to distress
    you.</p>
    <p>Distress me, my Lord?</p>
    <p>Think so, I beseech you, if I never return.&mdash;What would the misfortune be of
    falling low, even to the most abject in your opinion, compared with endangering the
    happiness of her whole peace is my ardent pursuit?&mdash;If I fail, I only can tell
    the cause:&mdash;you shall never be acquainted with it;&mdash;for should you regard
    me even with pity,&mdash;cool pity,&mdash;it would be taking the dagger from my own
    breast, and planting it in yours.</p>
    <p>Ah! my Lady, could I help understanding him?&mdash;could I help being
    moved?&mdash;I was moved;&mdash;my eyes I believe betrayed it.</p>
    <p>If I return, continued he, it is you only can pronounce me happy.&mdash;If you see
    me not again, think I am tossed on the waves of adverse fortune:&mdash;but oh think I
    again intreat <i>you</i>,&mdash;think me guilty. Perhaps I may outlive&mdash;no, that
    will never do;&mdash;you will be happy long before that hour;&mdash;it would be
    selfish to hope the contrary. I <i>wish</i> Mr. Powis was come home;&mdash;I
    wish&mdash;All my wishes tend to one great end.&mdash;Good God, what a situation am I
    in!&mdash;That the Dead could hear my petitions!&mdash;that he could absolve
    me!&mdash;What signifies, whether one sue to remains crumbled in the dust, or to the
    ear which can refuse to hear the voice of reason?</p>
    <p>I thought I should have sunk to see the agony he was work'd up to.&mdash;I believe
    I look'd very pale;&mdash;I felt the blood thrill through my veins, and of a sudden
    stagnate:&mdash;a dreadful sickness follow'd;&mdash;I desir'd to sit;&mdash;he look'd
    on every side, quite terrified;&mdash;cry'd, Where will you sit, my dearest
    life?&mdash;what shall I do?&mdash;For heaven's sake speak,&mdash;speak but one
    word;&mdash;speak to tell me, I have not been your murderer.</p>
    <p>I attempted to open my mouth, but in vain; I pointed to the ground, making an
    effort to sit down:&mdash;he caught me in his arms, and bore me to a bench not far
    off;&mdash;there left me, to fetch some water at a brook near, but came back before
    he had gone ten steps.&mdash;I held out my hand to his hat, which lay on the ground,
    then look'd to the water.&mdash;Thank God!&mdash;thank God! he said, and went full
    speed, to dip up some;&mdash;he knelt down, trembling, before me;&mdash;his teeth
    chatter'd in his head whilst he offer'd the water.</p>
    <p>I found myself beginning to recover the moment it came to my lips.&mdash;He fix'd
    his eyes on me, as if he never meant to take them off, holding both my hands between
    his, the tears running down his face, without the contraction of one
    feature.&mdash;If sorrow could be express'd in stone, he then appear'd the very
    statue which was to represent it.</p>
    <p>I attempted to speak.</p>
    <p>Don't speak yet, he cried;&mdash;don't make yourself ill again: thank heaven, you
    are better!&mdash;This is some sudden chill; why have you ventur'd out without
    clogs?</p>
    <p>How delicate,&mdash;how seasonable, this hint! Without it could I have met his
    eye, after the weakness I had betrayed?&mdash;We had now no more interesting
    subjects; I believe he thought I had <i>enough</i> of them.</p>
    <p>It was near two when we reach'd the Abbey. Sir James and Mr. Morgan were just
    return'd from a ride;&mdash;Lady Powis met us on the Green, where she said she had
    been walking some time, in expectation of her strollers,&mdash;She examin'd my
    countenance very attentively, and then ask'd Lord Darcey, if he had remember'd her
    injunctions?</p>
    <p>What reason, my Lady, have you to suspect the contrary? he returned&mdash;Well,
    well, said she, I shall find you out some day or other;&mdash;but her Ladyship seem'd
    quite satisfied, when I assured her I had been no farther than the Beach-walk.</p>
    <p>Cards were propos'd soon after dinner: the same party as usual.&mdash;Mr. Morgan
    is never ask'd to make one;&mdash;he says he would as soon see the devil as a
    card-table.&mdash;We kept close at it 'till supper.&mdash;I could not help observing
    his Lordship blunder'd a little;&mdash;playing a diamond for a spade,&mdash;and a
    heart for a club,&mdash;I took my leave at eleven, and he attended me home.</p>
    <p>Mr. and Mrs. Jenkings were gone to bed,&mdash;Edmund was reading in the parlour;
    he insisted on our having a negus which going out to order, was follow'd by Lord
    Darcey:&mdash;I heard them whisper in the passage, but could distinguish the words,
    <i>if she is ill, remember, if she is ill</i>&mdash;and then Edmund answer'd, You may
    depend on it, my Lord,&mdash;as I have a soul to be saved:&mdash;does your Lordship
    suppose I would be so negligent?</p>
    <p>I guess'd at this charge;&mdash;it was to write, if I should be ill, as I have
    since found by Edmund,&mdash;who return'd capering into the room, rubbing his hands,
    and smiling with such significance as if he would have said, Every thing is as it
    should be.</p>
    <p>When his Lordship had wish'd us a good night, he said to
    me,&mdash;<i>To-morrow</i>, Miss Warley!&mdash;but I will say nothing of
    <i>to-morrow</i>;&mdash;I shall see you in the morning. His eyes glisten'd, and he
    left the room hastily.&mdash;Whilst Edmund attended him out, I went to my chamber
    that I might avoid a subject of which I saw his honest heart was full.</p>
    <p>On my table lay the Roman History; I could not help giving a peep where I had left
    off, being a very interesting part:&mdash;from one thing I was led to another, 'till
    the clock struck three; which alarm made me quit my book.</p>
    <p>Whilst undressing, I had leisure to recollect the incidents of the pass'd day;
    sometimes pleasure, sometimes pain, would arise, from this examination; yet the
    latter was most predominant.</p>
    <p>When I consider'd Lord Darcey's tender regard for my future, as well as present
    peace,&mdash;how could I reflect on him without gratitude?&mdash;When I consider'd
    his perplexities, I thought thus:&mdash;they arise from some entanglement, in which
    his heart is not engag'd.&mdash;Had he confided in me, I should not have weaken'd his
    resolutions;&mdash;I would no more wish him to be guilty of a breach of honour, than
    surrender myself to infamy.&mdash;I would have endeavour'd to persuade him <i>she</i>
    is amiable, virtuous, and engaging.&mdash;If I had been successful, I would have
    <i>frown'd</i> when he <i>smil'd</i>;&mdash;I would have been <i>gay</i> when he
    seem'd <i>oppress'd</i>&mdash;I would have been <i>reserv'd, peevish,
    supercilicus</i>;&mdash;in short, I would have counterfeited the very reverse of what
    was likely to draw him from a former attachment.</p>
    <p>To live without him must be my fate; since that is almost inevitable, I would have
    strove to have secur'd his happiness, whilst mine had remain'd to chance.&mdash;These
    reflections kept me awake 'till six; when I fell into a profound sleep, which lasted
    'till ten; at which time I was awaken'd by Mrs. Jenkings to tell me Lord Darcey was
    below; with an apology, that she had made breakfast, as her husband was preparing, in
    great haste, to attend his Lordship.</p>
    <p>This was a hint he was not to stay long; so I put on my cloaths with expedition;
    and going down, took with me my whole stock of resolution; but I carried it no
    farther than the bottom of the stairs;&mdash;there it flew from me;&mdash;never have
    I seen it since:&mdash;that it rested not in the breast of Lord Darcey, was
    visible;&mdash;rather it seem'd as if his and mine had taken a flight together.</p>
    <p>I stood with the lock of the door in my hand more than a minute, in hopes my
    inward flutterings would abate.&mdash;His Lordship heard my footstep, and flew to
    open it;&mdash;I gave him my hand, without knowing what I did;&mdash;joy sparkled in
    his eyes and he prest it to his breast with a fervour that cover'd me with
    confusion.</p>
    <p>He saw what he had done,&mdash;He dropp'd it respectfully, and inquiring tenderly
    for my health, ask'd if I would honour him with my commands before he sat out for
    Town?&mdash;What a fool was I!&mdash;Lord bless me!&mdash;can I ever forget my folly?
    What do you think, my Lady! I did not speak;&mdash;no! I could not answer;&mdash;I
    was <i>silent</i>;&mdash;I was <i>silent</i>, when I would have given the world for
    one word.&mdash;When I did speak, it was not to Lord Darcey, but, still all fool,
    turn'd and said to Mr. Jenkings, who was looking over a parchment, How do you find
    yourself, Sir? Will not the journey you are going to take on horseback be too
    fatiguing? No, no, my good Lady; it is an exercise I have all my life been us'd to:
    to-morrow you will see me return the better for it.</p>
    <p>Mrs. Jenkings here enter'd, follow'd by a servant with the breakfast, which was
    plac'd before me, every one else having breakfasted.&mdash;She desir'd I would give
    myself the trouble of making tea, having some little matters to do
    without.&mdash;This task would have been a harder penance than a fast of three
    days;&mdash;but I must have submitted, had not my good genius Edmund appear'd at this
    moment; and placing himself by me, desir'd to have the honour of making my
    breakfast.</p>
    <p>I carried the cup with difficulty to my mouth. My embarrassment was perceiv'd by
    his Lordship; he rose from his seat, and walk'd up and down.&mdash;How did his manly
    form struggle to conceal the disorder of his mind!&mdash;Every movement, every look,
    every word, discover'd Honour in her most graceful, most ornamental garb: <i>when</i>
    could it appear to such advantage, surrounded with a cloud of difficulties, yet
    shining out and towering above them all?</p>
    <p>He laid his cold hand on mine;&mdash;with precipitation left the room;&mdash;and
    was in a moment again at my elbow.&mdash;Leaning over the back of my chair, he
    whisper'd, For heaven's sake, miss Warley, be the instrument of my fortitude; whilst
    I see you I cannot&mdash;there stopt and turn'd from me.&mdash;I saw he wish'd me to
    go first,&mdash;as much in compassion to myself as him. When his back was turn'd, I
    should have slid out of the room;&mdash;but Mr. Jenkings starting up, and looking at
    his watch, exclaim'd, <i>Odso</i>, my Lord! it is past eleven; we shall be in the
    dark. This call'd him from his reverie; and he sprang to the door, just as I had
    reached it.&mdash;Sweet, generous creature! said he, stopping me; and you will go
    <i>then?</i>&mdash;Farewell, my Lord, replied I.&mdash;My dear, good friend, to Mr.
    Jenkings, take care of your health.&mdash;God bless you both I&mdash;My voice
    faulter'd.</p>
    <p>Excellent Miss Warley! a thousand thanks for your kind condescension, said the
    good old man.&mdash;Yet one moment, oh God! yet one moment, said his Lordship; and he
    caught both my hands.</p>
    <p>Come, my Lord, return'd Mr. Jenkings; and never did I see him look so grave,
    something of disappointment in his countenance;&mdash;come, my Lord, the day is
    wasting apace. Excuse this liberty:&mdash;your Lordship has been <i>long</i>
    determin'd,&mdash;have <i>long</i> known of leaving this country.&mdash;My dearest
    young Lady, you will be expected at the Abbey.&mdash;I shall, indeed, replied
    I;&mdash;so God bless you, Sir!&mdash;God bless you, my Lord! and, withdrawing my
    hands, hasten'd immediately to my chamber.</p>
    <p>I heard their voices in the court-yard:&mdash;if I had look'd out at the window,
    it might not have been unnatural,&mdash;I own my inclinations led to
    it.&mdash;Inclination should never take place of prudence;&mdash;by following one, we
    are often plung'd into difficulties;&mdash;by the other we are sure to be conducted
    safely:&mdash;instead, then, of indulging my curiosity to see how he look'd&mdash;how
    he spoke at taking leave of this dwelling;&mdash;whether his eyes were directed to
    the windows, or the road;&mdash;if he rid slow or fast;&mdash;how often he turn'd to
    gaze, before he was out of sight:&mdash;instead of this, I went to Mrs. Jenkings's
    apartment, and remain'd there 'till I heard they were gone, then return'd to my own;
    since which I have wrote down to this period. Perhaps I should have ran on farther,
    if a summons from Lady Powis did not call me off. I hope now to appear before her
    with tolerable composure.&mdash;I am to go in the coach alone.&mdash;Well, it will
    seem strange!&mdash;I shall think of my <i>late</i> companion;&mdash;but time
    reconciles every thing.&mdash;<i>This</i> was my hope, when I lost my best friend,
    the lov'd instructress of my infant years.&mdash;<i>Time</i>, all healing
    <i>Time!</i> to <i>that</i> I fear I must look forward, as a lenitive against many
    evils.</p>
    <p>Two days!&mdash;only two days!&mdash;and then, adieu, my dear friends at the
    Abbey;&mdash;adieu, my good Mr. and Mrs. Jenkings!&mdash;and you <i>too</i>, my
    friendly-hearted Edmund, adieu!</p>
    <p>Welcome,&mdash;doubly welcome, every moment which brings me nearer to that when I
    shall kiss the hands of my honour'd Lady;&mdash;when I shall be able to tell you, in
    person, ten thousand things too much for my pen;&mdash;when you will kindly say, Tell
    me all, my Fanny, tell me every secret of your heart.&mdash;Happy
    sounds!&mdash;pleasing sounds! these will be to your grateful and affectionate</p>

    <h2>LETTER XXV.</h2>
    <p>Miss WARLEY to the same.</p>
    <p><i>From Mr. Jenkings's</i>.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Now, my dear Lady, am I ready for my departure:&mdash;Sir James and Lady Powis
    reconciled to my leaving them;&mdash;yet how can I call it reconciled, when I tear
    myself from their arms as they weep over me?&mdash;Heavens! how tenderly they love
    me!&mdash;Their distress, when I told them the day was absolutely fix'd; when I told
    them the necessity of my going, <i>their</i> distress nothing could equal but my
    <i>own</i>.&mdash;I thought my heart would have sunk within me!&mdash;Surely, my
    Lady, my affection for them is not a common affection;&mdash;it is <i>such</i> as I
    hear your dear self;&mdash;it is <i>such</i> as I felt for my revered Mrs.
    Whitmore.&mdash;I cannot dwell on this subject&mdash;indeed I cannot.</p>
    <p>I almost wish I had not kept the day so long a secret.&mdash;But suppose I had
    not,&mdash;would their concern have been lessen'd?</p>
    <p>I would give the world, if Mr. Jenkings was come home:&mdash;his wife is like a
    frantic woman; and declares, if I persist in going, I shall break the heart of her
    and her husband.&mdash;Why do they love me so well?&mdash;It cannot be from any
    deserts of mine:&mdash;I have done no more than common gratitude demands;&mdash;the
    affection I shew them is only the result of their own kindness.&mdash;Benevolent
    hearts never place any thing to their own account:&mdash;they look on returns as
    presents, not as just debts:&mdash;so, whether giving or receiving, the glory must be
    their's.</p>
    <p>I fancy Mr. Smith will not be here 'till to morrow, his Lady having wrote me, he
    intended spending the evening with an acquaintance of his about six miles from the
    Abbey.</p>
    <p>How I dread the hour of parting!&mdash;Poor Mr. Watson!&mdash;I fear I shall never
    see <i>him</i> more.&mdash;Mr. Morgan <i>too!</i> but he is likely to live many
    years.&mdash;There is something in this strange man excessively engaging.&mdash;If
    people have roughness, better to appear in the voice, in the air and dress, than in
    the heart: a want of softness <i>there</i>, I never can dispense with.&mdash;What is
    a graceful form, what are numberless accomplishments, without humanity? I love, I
    revere, the honest, plain, well-meaning Mr. Morgan.</p>
    <p>Hark! I hear the trampling of horses.&mdash;Mr. Jenkings is certainly
    return'd.&mdash;I hasten down to be the first who shall inform him of my
    departure.</p>
    <p>How am I mortified to see Aaron return without his master!&mdash;Whilst Mrs.
    Jenkings was busied in enquiries after the health of her good man, I was all
    impatience for the contents of a letter she held in her hand, unopen'd: having broke
    the seal, and run her eye hastily over it, she gave it me.&mdash;I think my
    recollection will serve to send it verbatim to your Ladyship.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Mr. JENKINGS to Mrs. JENKINGS.</p>
    <p>"My Dear,</p>
    <p>I dispatch Aaron to acquaint you it is impossible for me to be home till
    Wednesday. Mr. Stapleton is gone to London: I am obliged to attend Lord Darcey
    thither. I love his Lordship <i>more</i> and <i>more</i>.&mdash;He has convinc'd me
    <i>our</i> conjectures were not without foundation.&mdash;Heaven grant it may end to
    <i>our</i> wishes!&mdash;There are, he thinks, difficulties to be overcome. Let him
    think it:&mdash;his happiness will be more exquisite when he is
    undeceiv'd.&mdash;Distribute my dutiful respects to Sir James, Lady Powis, and Miss
    Warley; next to yourself and our dear Edmund, they are nearest the heart of your
    truly affectionate husband</p>
    <p>JENKINGS."</p>
    <p>I will make no comments on this letter; it cannot concern <i>me</i>,&mdash;What
    can I do about seeing Mr. Jenkings before I go?&mdash;</p>
    <p>Lord bless me! a chaise and four just stopp'd; Mr. Smith in it.&mdash;Heavens! how
    my heart throbs!&mdash;I did not expect him 'till to-morrow: I must run to receive
    him.&mdash;How shall I go up to the Abbey!&mdash;how support the last embrace of Sir
    James and Lady Powis!</p>
    <br />

    <p>Ten at Night, just come from the Abbey.</p>
    <p>Torn in pieces!&mdash;my poor heart torn in pieces!&mdash;I shall never see them
    more;&mdash;never again be strain'd to their parental bosoms.&mdash;Forgive me, my
    dearest Lady, I do not grieve that I am coming to <i>you</i>; I grieve only that I go
    from <i>them</i>.&mdash;Oh God! why must my soul be divided?</p>
    <p>Another struggle too with poor Mrs. Jenkings!&mdash;She has been on her
    knees:&mdash;yes, thus lowly has she condescended to turn me from my purpose, and
    suffer Mr. Smith to go back without me,&mdash;I blush to think what pain, what
    trouble I occasion.&mdash;She talks of some <i>important event</i> at hand. She says
    if I go, it will, end in the destruction of us all.&mdash;What can she mean by an
    <i>important event?</i>&mdash;Perhaps Lord Darcey&mdash;but no matter; nothing, my
    dear Lady, shall with-hold me from you.&mdash;The good woman is now more calm. I have
    assured her it is uncertain how long we may be in London: it is only that has calm'd
    her.&mdash;She says, she is <i>certain</i> I shall return;&mdash;she is
    <i>certain</i>, when Mr. Powis and his Lady arrives, <i>I must</i> return.&mdash;Next
    Thursday they are expected:&mdash;already are they arrived at Falmouth:&mdash;but,
    notwithstanding what I have told Mrs. Jenkings, to soften her pains at parting, I
    shall by Thursday be on my voyage;&mdash;for Mr. Smith tells me the Packet will sail
    immediately.&mdash;Perhaps I may be the messenger of my own letters:&mdash;but I am
    determin'd to write on 'till I see you;&mdash;that when I look them over, my memory
    may receive some assistance.&mdash;Good night, my dearest Lady; Mrs. Jenkings and Mr.
    Smith expects me.</p>

    <p>London.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Even whilst I write, I see before me the image of my expiring father;&mdash;I hear
    the words that issued from his death-like lips;&mdash;my soul feels the weight of his
    injunctions;&mdash;<i>again</i> in my imagination I seal the sacred promise on his
    livid hand;&mdash;and my heart bows before Sir James with all that duty which is
    indispensable from a child to a parent.</p>
    <p>Happiness is within my reach, yet without <i>your</i> sanction I <i>will</i> not,
    <i>dare</i> not, bid it welcome;&mdash;I <i>will</i> not hold out my hand to receive
    <i>it</i>.&mdash;Yes, Sir, I love Miss Warley; I can no longer disguise my
    sentiments.&mdash;On the terrace I should not have disguis'd them, if your warmth had
    not made me tremble for the consequence.&mdash;You remember my arguments <i>then</i>;
    suffer me now to reurge <i>them</i>.</p>
    <p>I allow it would be convenient to have my fortune augmented by alliance; but then
    it is not <i>absolutely</i> necessary I should make the purchase with my
    felicity.&mdash;A thousand chances may put me in possession of riches;&mdash;one
    event only can put me in possession of content.&mdash;Without <i>it</i>, what is a

    <p>I am not much surpris'd at the contents of your Lordship's letter, it is
    <i>what</i> Lady Powis and I have long conjectur'd; yet I must tell, you, my Lord,
    notwithstanding Miss Warley's great merit, I should have been much better pleas'd to
    have found myself mistaken.</p>
    <p>I claim no right to controul your inclinations: the strict observance you pay your
    father's last request, tempts me to give my opinion very opposite to what I should
    otherwise have done.&mdash;Duty like yours ought to be rewarded.&mdash;If you will
    content yourself with an incumber'd estate rather than a clear one,
    why&mdash;why&mdash;why&mdash;faith you shall not have my approbation 'till you come
    to the Abbey. Should you see the little bewitching Gipsy before I talk with you, who
    knows but you may be wise enough to make a larger jointure than you can afford?</p>
    <p>I am glad your Lordship push'd the matter no farther on the terrace: I did not
    then know how well I lov'd our dear girl.&mdash;My wife is <i>so</i>
    pleas'd,&mdash;<i>so</i> happy,&mdash;<i>so</i> overjoy'd,&mdash;at what she calls
    your noble disinterested regard for her Fanny, that one would think she had quite
    forgot the value of <i>money</i>.&mdash;I expect my son to-morrow.&mdash;Let me have
    the happiness of embracing you at the same time;&mdash;you are both my children,

    <p>The Honourable GEORGE MOLESWORTH to RICHARD RISBY, Esq;</p>
    <p><i>Dover</i>.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Oh Dick! the most dreadful affair has happen'd!&mdash;Lord Darcey is distracted
    and dying; I am little better&mdash;Good God! what shall I do?&mdash;what can I
    do?&mdash;He lies on the floor in the next room, with half his hair torn
    off.&mdash;Unhappy man! fatigue had near kill'd him, before the melancholy account
    reach'd his ears.&mdash;Miss Warley, I mean Miss Powis, is gone to the
    bottom.&mdash;She sunk in the yacht that sailed yesterday from Dover for
    Calais.&mdash;Every soul is lost.&mdash;The fatal accident was confirm'd by a boat
    which came in not ten minutes before we arriv'd.&mdash;There was no keeping it from
    Lord Darcey.&mdash;The woman of the Inn we are at has a son lost in the same vessel:
    she was in fits when we alighted.&mdash;Some of the wreck is drove on
    shore.&mdash;What can equal this scene!&mdash;Oh, Miss Powis! most amiable of women,
    I tremble for your relations!&mdash;But Darcey, poor Darcey, what do I feel for
    you!&mdash;He speaks:&mdash;he calls for me:&mdash;I go to him.</p>
    <p>Oh, Risby! my heart is breaking; for once let it be said a man's heart can
    break.&mdash;Whilst he rav'd, whilst his sorrows were loud, there was some chance;
    but now all is over. He is absolutely dying;&mdash;death is in every
    feature.&mdash;His convulsions how dreadful!&mdash;how dreadful the pale horror of
    his countenance!&mdash;But then so calm,&mdash;so compos'd!&mdash;I repeat, there
    can, be no chance.&mdash;</p>
    <p>Where is Molesworth? I heard him say as I enter'd his apartment: come to me, my
    friend,&mdash;<i>holding out his hand</i>&mdash;come to me, my friend.&mdash;Don't
    weep&mdash;don't let me leave you in tears.&mdash;If you wish me well,
    rejoice:&mdash;think how I should have dragg'd out a miserable number of days,
    after&mdash;oh, George! after&mdash;Here he stopp'd.&mdash;The surgeon desir'd he
    would suffer us to lift him on the bed.&mdash;No, he said, in a faultering accent, if
    I move I shall die before I have made known to my friend my last request.&mdash;Upon
    which the physician and surgeon retir'd to a distant part of the room, to give him an
    opportunity of speaking with greater freedom.</p>
    <p>He caught hold of my hand with the grasp of anguish, saying, Go, go. I entreat
    you, by that steady regard which has subsisted between us,&mdash;<i>go</i> to the
    unhappy family:&mdash;if they can be comforted; ay, if they <i>can</i>, you must
    undertake the task.&mdash;<i>I</i> will die without you.&mdash;Tell them I send the
    thanks, the duty, of a dying man;&mdash;that they must consider me as their own. A
    few, a <i>very</i> few hours! and I shall be their own;&mdash;I shall be united to
    their angel daughter.&mdash;Dear soul, he cried, is it for this,&mdash;for this, I
    tore myself from you!&mdash;But stop, I will not repine; the reward of my sufferings
    is at hand.</p>
    <p><i>Now</i>, you may lift me on the bed;&mdash;<i>now</i>, my friend, pointing to
    the door,&mdash;<i>now</i>, my dear Molesworth, if you wish I should die
    in&mdash;<i>there fainted</i>.&mdash;He lay without signs of life so long, that I
    thought, all was over.&mdash;</p>
    <p>I cannot comply with his last request;&mdash;it is his last I am
    convinc'd;&mdash;he will never speak more, Risby!&mdash;he will never <i>more</i>
    pronounce the name of Molesworth.</p>
    <p>Be yours the task he assign'd me.&mdash;Go instantly to the friends you
    revere;&mdash;go to Mr. and Mrs. Powis, the poor unfortunate parents.&mdash;Abroad
    they were to you as tender relations;&mdash;in England, your first returns of
    gratitude will be mournful.&mdash;You have seen Miss Powis:&mdash;it could be no
    other than that lovely creature whom you met so accidentally at &mdash;&mdash;: the
    likeness she bore to her father startled you. She was then going with Mr. Jenkings
    into Oxfordshire:&mdash;you admired her;&mdash;but had you known her mind, how would
    you have felt for Darcey!</p>
    <p>Be cautious, tender, and circumspect, in your sad undertaking.&mdash;Go first to
    the old steward's, about a mile from the Abbey; if he is not return'd, break it to
    his wife and son.&mdash;They will advise, they will assist you, in the dreadful
    affair;&mdash;I hope the poor old gentleman has not proceeded farther than
    London.&mdash;Write the moment you have seen the family; write every melancholy
    particular: my mind is only fit for such gloomy recitals.&mdash;Farewel! I go to my
    dying friend.</p>

    <h2>LETTER XXX.</h2>
    <p>Captain RISBY to the Honourable GEORGE MOLESWORTH,</p>
    <p><i>Barford Abbey</i>.</p>
    <br />

    <p>What is the sight of thousands slain in the field of battle, compar'd with the
    scene I am just escap'd from!&mdash;How can I be circumstantial!&mdash;where am I to
    begin!&mdash;whose distress shall I paint first!&mdash;can there be precedence in
    sorrow!</p>
    <p>What a weight will human nature support before it sinks!&mdash;The distress'd
    inhabitants of this house are still alive; it is proclaim'd from every room by
    dreadful groans.&mdash;You sent me on a raven's message:&mdash;like that ill-boding
    bird I flew from house to house, afraid to croak my direful tidings.</p>
    <p>By your directions I went to the steward's;&mdash;at the gate stood my dear
    friends, Mr. and Mrs. Powis, arm in arm.&mdash;I thought I should have sunk;&mdash;I
    thought I should have died instantly.&mdash;I was turning my horse to go back, and
    leave my black errand to be executed by another.</p>
    <p>They were instantly at my side;&mdash;a hand was seiz'd by each,&mdash;and the
    words Risby!&mdash;captain Risby!&mdash;ecchoed in my ears.&mdash;What with their
    joyous welcomes,&mdash;and transported countenances, I felt as if a flash of
    lightning had just darted on my head.&mdash;Mrs. Powis first perceiv'd the alteration
    and ask'd if I was well;&mdash;if any thing had happen'd to give me concern?</p>
    <p>Certainly there has, said Mr. Powis, or <i>you</i> are not the same man you
    <i>was</i>, Risby.&mdash;It is true, Sir, return'd I;&mdash;it is true, I am not
    <i>so</i> happy as when I last saw <i>you</i>;&mdash;my mind is disagreeably
    situated;&mdash;could I receive joy, it would be in knowing this amiable woman to be
    Mrs. Powis.</p>
    <p>You both surprise and affect us, replied he.</p>
    <p>Indeed you do, join'd in his Lady; but we will try to remove your
    uneasiness:&mdash;pray let us conduct you to the Abbey; you are come to the best
    house in the world to heal grievances.&mdash;Ah, Risby! said my friend, all there is
    happiness.&mdash;Dick, I have the sweetest daughter: but Lord Darcey, I suppose, has
    told you every thing; we desir'd he would; and that we might see you
    immediately.&mdash;Can <i>you</i> tell us if his Lordship is gone on to Dover?</p>
    <p>He is, returned I.&mdash;I did not wait his coming down, wanting to discover to
    you the reason of my perplexities.</p>
    <p>What excuse after saying this, could I make, for going into the
    steward's?&mdash;For my soul, I could not think of any.&mdash;Fortunately it enter'd
    my head to say, that I had been wrong directed;&mdash;that a foolish boy had told me
    this was the strait road to the Abbey.</p>
    <p>Mr. and Mrs. Powis importun'd me to let the servant lead my horse, that I might
    walk home with them.&mdash;<i>This</i> would never do.&mdash;I could not longer trust
    myself in <i>their</i> company, 'till I had reconnoitred the family;&mdash;'till I
    had examin'd who <i>there</i> was best fitted to bear the first onset of
    sorrow.&mdash;I brought myself off by saying, one of my legs was hurt with a tight
    boot.</p>
    <p>Well then, go on, Risby, said Mr. Powis: you see the Abbey just before you; my
    wife and I will walk fast;&mdash;we shall be but a few minutes behind.</p>
    <p>My faculties were quite unhing'd, the sight of the noble structure.&mdash;I
    stopp'd, paus'd, then rode on; stopp'd again, irresolute whether to
    proceed.&mdash;Recollecting your strict injunctions, I reach'd the gate which leads
    to the back entrance; there I saw a well-looking gentleman and the game-keeper just
    got off their horses:&mdash;the former, after paying me the compliment of his hat,
    took a brace of hares from the keeper, and went into the house.&mdash;I ask'd of a
    servant who stood by, if that was Sir James Powis?</p>
    <p>No, Sir, he replied; but Sir James is within.</p>
    <p>Who is that gentleman? return'd I.</p>
    <p>His name is Morgan, Sir,</p>
    <p>Very intimate here, I suppose&mdash;is he not?</p>
    <p>Yes, very intimate, Sir.</p>
    <p>Then <i>he</i> is the person I have business with; pray tell him <i>so</i>.</p>
    <p>The servant obey'd.&mdash;Mr. Morgan came to me, before I had dismounted; and
    accosting me very genteely, ask'd what my commands were with him?</p>
    <p>Be so obliging, Sir, I replied; to go a small distance from the house; and I will
    unfold an affair which I am sorry to be the messenger of.</p>
    <p>Nothing is amiss, Sir, I hope: you look strangely terrified; but I'll go with you
    this instant.&mdash;On that he led me by a little path to a walk planted thick with
    elms; at one end of which was a bench, where we seated ourselves.&mdash;<i>Now</i>,
    Sir, said Mr. Morgan, you may <i>here</i> deliver what you have to say with
    secrecy.&mdash;I don't recollect to have had the honour of seeing <i>you</i>
    before;&mdash;but I wait with impatience to be inform'd the occasion of this
    visit.</p>
    <p>You are a friend, I presume, of Sir James Powis?</p>
    <p>Yes, Sir, I am: he has <i>few</i> of longer standing, and, as times go,
    <i>more</i> sincere, I believe.&mdash;But what of that?&mdash;do you know any harm,
    Sir, of me, or of my friend?</p>
    <p>God knows I do not;&mdash;but I am acquainted, Mr. Morgan, with an unfortunate
    circumstance relative to Sir James.</p>
    <p>Sir James! Zounds, do speak out:&mdash;Sir James, to my knowledge, does not owe a
    shilling.</p>
    <p>It is not money matters, Sir, that brought me here:&mdash;heaven grant it was!</p>
    <p>The devil, Sir!&mdash;tell me at once, what is this damn'd affair? Upon my soul,
    you must tell me immediately.</p>
    <p>Behold!&mdash;read, Sir&mdash;what a task is mine! (<i>putting your letter into
    his hands</i>.)</p>
    <p>Never was grief, surprize, and disappointment so strongly painted as in
    him.&mdash;At first, he stood quite silent; every feature distorted:&mdash;then
    starting back some paces, threw his hat over the hedge:&mdash;stamp'd on his
    wig;&mdash;and was stripping himself naked, to fling his clothes into a pond just by,
    when I prevented him.</p>
    <p>Stop, Sir, I cried: do not alarm the family before they are prepar'd.&mdash;Think
    of the dreadful consequences;&mdash;think of the unhappy parents!&mdash;Let us
    consult how to break it to them, without severing their hearts at one blow.</p>
    <p>Zounds, Sir, don't talk to me of breaking it; I shall go mad:&mdash;you did not
    know her.&mdash;Oh! she was the most lovely, gentle creature!&mdash;What an old
    blockhead have I been!&mdash;Why did I not give her my fortune?&mdash;<i>then</i>
    Darcey would have married her;&mdash;<i>then</i> she would not have gone
    abroad;&mdash;<i>then</i> we should have sav'd her. Oh, she was a sweet, dear
    soul!&mdash;What good will my curst estates do me <i>now?</i>&mdash;You shall have
    them, Sir;&mdash;any body shall have them&mdash;I don't care what becomes of
    <i>me</i>.&mdash;Do order my horse, Sir&mdash;I say again, do order my horse. I'll
    never see this place more.&mdash;Oh! my dear, sweet, smiling girl, why would you go
    to France?</p>
    <p>Here I interrupted him.</p>
    <p>Think not, talk not, Sir, of leaving the family in such a melancholy
    situation.&mdash;Pray recollect yourself.&mdash;You <i>ought</i> not to run from your
    friends;&mdash;you <i>ought</i> to redouble your affection at this hour of
    trial.&mdash;Who <i>can</i> be call'd friends, but those who press forward, when all
    the satisfactions of life draw back.&mdash;You are not;&mdash;your feeling heart
    tells me you are not one of the many that retire with such visionary
    enjoyments.&mdash;Come, Sir, for the present forget the part you bear in this
    disaster:&mdash;consider,&mdash;pray, consider her poor parents; consider what will
    be their sufferings:&mdash;let it be our task to prepare them.</p>
    <p>What you say is very right, Sir, return'd he.&mdash;I believe you are a good
    christian;&mdash;God direct us,&mdash;God direct us.&mdash;I wish I had a
    dram:&mdash;faith, I shall be choak'd.&mdash;Sweet creature!&mdash;what will become
    of Lord Darcey!&mdash;I never wanted a dram so much before.&mdash;Your name, Sir, if
    you please.&mdash;I perceive we shall make matters worse by staying out so long.</p>
    <p>I told him my name; and that I had the honour of being intimately acquainted with
    Mr. and Mrs. Powis.</p>
    <p>He continued,&mdash;You will go in <i>with me</i>, Sir.&mdash;How am I to
    act!&mdash;I'll follow your advice&mdash;We must expect it will be a dreadful piece
    of work.&mdash;</p>
    <p>Caution and tenderness, Mr. Morgan, will be absolutely necessary.</p>
    <p>But where is my hat?&mdash;where is my wig?&mdash;have I thrown them into the
    pond?</p>
    <p>It is well the poor distress'd man recollected he had them not; or, bare-headed as
    he was, I should have gone with him to the house.&mdash;I pick'd them up, all over
    dirt; and, well as I could, clean'd them with my handkerchief.</p>
    <p>Now, Sir, said I, if you will wipe your face,&mdash;for the sweat was standing on
    it in large drops,&mdash;I am ready to attend you.</p>
    <p>So I must <i>really</i> go in, captain.&mdash;I don't think I can stand
    it;&mdash;you had better go without me.&mdash;Upon my soul, I had sooner face the
    mouth of a cannon&mdash;If you would blow my brains out, it would be the kindest
    thing you ever did in your life.</p>
    <p>Poh! don't talk at this rate, Sir.&mdash;Do we live only for ourselves?&mdash;</p>
    <p>But <i>will</i> you not leave us, captain;&mdash;<i>will</i> you not run from us,
    when all is out?</p>
    <p>Rather, Sir, suspect me of cowardice.&mdash;I should receive greater satisfaction
    from administering the smallest consolation to people in distress, than from whole
    nations govern'd by my nod.</p>
    <p>Well, captain, I <i>will</i> go;&mdash;I <i>will</i> do any thing you desire me,
    since you are so good to say you will not leave us.</p>
    <p>But, notwithstanding his fair promise, I never expected to get him within the
    doors.&mdash;He was shifting from side to side:&mdash;sometimes he would stand
    still,&mdash;sometimes attempt to retreat.&mdash;When we were just at the house, a
    servant appear'd:&mdash;of whom he enquir'd, if Mr. and Mrs. Powis were return'd; and
    was inform'd the latter was within;&mdash;the former gone out in pursuit of us. We
    likewise found the Ladies were with Sir James in the library. I sent in my name: it
    was in vain for me to expect any introduction from my companion.</p>
    <p>Mrs. Powis flew to meet me at the door:&mdash;Mr. Morgan lifted up his eyes, and
    shook his head.&mdash;I never was so put to it:&mdash;I knew not what to say; or how
    to look.&mdash;Welcome, Mr. Risby, said the amiable, unfortunate, unsuspecting
    mother;&mdash;doubly welcome at this happy juncture.&mdash;Let me lead you to
    parents, introducing me to Sir James and Lady Powis, from whom I have receiv'd all my
    felicity.</p>
    <p>You need not be told my reception:&mdash;it is sufficient that you know Sir James
    and her Ladyship.&mdash;My eyes instantly turn'd on the venerable chaplin: I thought
    I never discover'd so much of the angel in a human form.</p>
    <p>Mrs. Powis ask'd me a thousand questions;&mdash;except answering <i>them</i>, I
    sat stupidly silent.&mdash;It was not so with Mr. Morgan: he walk'd, or rather ran up
    and down;&mdash;his eyes fix'd on the floor,&mdash;his lips in motion.&mdash;The
    Ladies spoke to him: he did not answer; and I could perceive them look on each other
    with surprize.</p>
    <p>Mr. Powis enter'd:&mdash;the room seem'd to lift up:&mdash;I quite rambled when I
    rose to receive his salute.&mdash;Mr. Morgan was giving me the slip.&mdash;I look'd
    at him significantly,&mdash;then at Mr. Watson,&mdash;as much as to say, Take him
    out; acquaint him with the sorrowful tidings.&mdash;He understood the hint, and
    immediately they withdrew together.</p>
    <p>Come, dear Risby, pluck up, said Mr. Powis:&mdash;do not you, my friend, be the
    only low-spirited person amongst us.&mdash;I fear Mr. Risby is not well, return'd
    Lady Powis.&mdash;We must not expect to see every one in high spirits, because
    <i>we</i> are:&mdash;<i>our</i> blessings must be consider'd as <i>very</i>
    singular.&mdash;You have not mention'd Fanny to your friends.</p>
    <p>Indeed, Madam, I have, replied he.&mdash;Risby knows, I every minute expect my
    belov'd daughter.&mdash;But tell me, Dick;&mdash;tell me, my friend;&mdash;all
    present are myself;&mdash;fear not to be candid;&mdash;what accident has thrown a
    cloud of sadness over your once chearful countenance?&mdash;Can I assist
    you?&mdash;My advice, my interest, my purse are all your own.&mdash;Nay, dear Risby,
    you must not turn from me.&mdash;I did turn, I could hold it no longer.&mdash;</p>
    <p>Pray Sir, said Mrs. Powis, do speak;&mdash;do command us; and she condescended to
    lay her hand on mine&mdash;Lady Powis, Sir James too, both intreated I would suffer
    them to make me happy.&mdash;Dear worthy creatures, how my heart bled! how it still
    bleeds for them!&mdash;</p>
    <p>I was attempting some awkward acknowledgment, when Mr. Watson enter'd, led by Mr.
    Morgan.&mdash;I saw he had executed the task, which made me shudder.&mdash;Never did
    the likeness of a being celestial shine more than in the former! He mov'd gently
    forward,&mdash;plac'd himself next Lady
    Powis;&mdash;pale,&mdash;trembling,&mdash;sinking.&mdash;Mr. Morgan retir'd to the
    window.&mdash;</p>
    <p>Now,&mdash;now,&mdash;the dreadful discovery was at a crisis.&mdash;Mr. Watson
    sigh'd.&mdash;Lady Powis eyed him with attention; then starting up, cried, Bless me!
    I hear wheels: suppose, Mr. Watson, it should be Fanny!&mdash;and after looking into
    the lawn resum'd her chair.</p>
    <p>Pardon me, Lady Powis said. Mr. Watson in a low-voice; why <i>this</i>
    impatience?&mdash;Ah Madam! I could rather wish you to check than encourage
    <i>it</i>.</p>
    <p>Hold, hold, my worthy friend, return'd Sir James; do you forget four hours since
    how you stood listening at a gate by the road-side, saying, you could hear, tho' not
    see?</p>
    <p>We must vary our hopes and inclinations, reply'd Mr. Watson.&mdash;Divine
    Providence&mdash;there stopp'd;&mdash;not another word.&mdash;He stopp'd;&mdash;he
    groan'd;&mdash;and was silent.&mdash;Great God! cried Mr. Powis, is my child
    ill?&mdash;Is my child dead? frantickly echoed Mrs. Powis&mdash;Heaven forbid!
    exclaim'd Sir James and his Lady, arising.&mdash;Tell us, Mr. Watson;&mdash;tell us,
    Mr. Ruby.</p>
    <p>When you are compos'd,&mdash;return'd the former&mdash;Then, our child is
    dead,&mdash;really dead! shriek'd the parents.&mdash;No, no, cried Lady Powis,
    clasping her son and daughter in her arms,&mdash;she is, not dead; I am sure she is
    not dead.</p>
    <p>Mr. Watson, after many efforts to speak, said in a faultering
    voice,&mdash;Consider we are christians:&mdash;let that bless'd name fortify our
    souls.</p>
    <p>Mrs. Powis fell on her knees before him,&mdash;heart-rending sight!&mdash;her cap
    torn off,&mdash;her hair dishevell'd,&mdash;her eyes fix'd;&mdash;not a
    tear,&mdash;not a single tear to relieve the bitter anguish of her soul.</p>
    <p>Sir James had left the room;&mdash;Lady Powis was sunk almost senseless on the
    sopha;&mdash;Mr. Powis kneeling by his wife, clasping her to his bosom;&mdash;Mr.
    Morgan in a corner roaring out his affliction;&mdash;Mr. Watson with the voice of an
    angel speaking consolation.&mdash;I say nothing of my own feelings.&mdash;God, how
    great!&mdash;how inexpressible! when Mrs. Powis, still on her knees, turn'd to me
    with uplifted hands,&mdash;Oh Mr. Risby! cried she,&mdash;can <i>you,</i>&mdash;can
    <i>you</i> speak comfort to the miserable?&mdash;Then again addressing Mr.
    Watson,&mdash;Dear, saint, only say she lives:&mdash;I ask no more; only say she
    lives.&mdash;My best love!&mdash;my life!&mdash;my Fanny! said Mr. Powis, lifting her
    to the sopha;&mdash;live,&mdash;live,&mdash;for my sake.&mdash;Oh!&mdash;Risby, are
    <i>you</i> the messenger?&mdash;his head fell on my shoulder, and he sobb'd
    aloud.</p>
    <p>Lady Powis beckon'd him towards her, and, looking at Mrs. Powis with an expressive
    glance of tenderness,&mdash;said Compose yourself, my son;&mdash;what will become of
    <i>you, if</i>&mdash;He took the meaning of her words, and wrapping his arms about
    his wife, seem'd for a moment to forget his own sorrow in endeavours to.</p>
    <p>What an exalted woman is Lady Powis!</p>
    <p>My children, said she; taking a hand from each,&mdash;I am thankful: whom the Lord
    loveth he chasteneth.&mdash;Let us follow his great example of patience,&mdash;of
    resignation.&mdash;What is a poor span?&mdash;<i>Ours</i> will be eternity.</p>
    <p>I whisper'd Mr. Morgan, a female friend would be necessary to attend the
    Ladies;&mdash;one whom they lov'd,&mdash;whom they confided in, to be constantly with
    them in their apartments.&mdash;He knew just such a woman, he said; and went himself
    to fetch Mrs. Jenkings.&mdash;Lady Powis being unable longer to support herself,
    propos'd withdrawing.&mdash;I offered my arm, which she accepted, and led her to the
    dressing-room.&mdash;Mrs. Powis follow'd; almost lifeless, leaning on her husband:
    there I left them together, and walk'd out for a quarter of an hour to recover my
    confus'd senses.</p>
    <p>At my return to the library, I found Sir James and Mr. Watson in
    conversation.&mdash;The former, with a countenance of horror and
    distraction,&mdash;Oh Sir! said he, as I came near him,&mdash;do I see you
    again?&mdash;are you kind enough not to run from our distress?</p>
    <p>Run from it, Sir James! I reply'd;&mdash;no, I will stay and be a partaker.</p>
    <p>Oh Sir! he continued, you know not <i>my</i> distress:&mdash;death only can
    relieve <i>me</i>&mdash;I am without <i>hope</i>, without <i>comfort</i>.</p>
    <p>And is this, Sir James, what you are arriv'd at? said the good chaplain&mdash;Is
    this what you have been travelling sixty years after?&mdash;Wish for death yet say
    you have neither hope or comfort.&mdash;Your good Lady, Sir, is full of
    both;&mdash;<i>she</i> rejoices in affliction:&mdash;<i>she</i> has long look'd above
    this world.</p>
    <p>So might I, he reply'd,&mdash;had I no more to charge myself with than she
    has.&mdash;<i>You</i> know, Mr. Watson,&mdash;<i>you</i> know how faulty I have
    been.</p>
    <p>Your errors, dear Sir James, said he, are not remember'd.&mdash;Look back on the
    reception you gave your son and daughter.</p>
    <p>He made no reply; but shedding a flood of tears, went to his afflicted family.</p>
    <p>Mr. Watson, it seems, whilst I had been out, acquainted him with the contents of
    your letter;&mdash;judging it the most seasonable time, as their grief could not then
    admit of increase.</p>
    <p>Sir James was scarce withdrawn, when Lady Powis sent her woman to request the
    sight of it.&mdash;As I rose to give it into her hand, I saw Mr. Morgan pass by the
    door, conducting an elderly woman, whom I knew afterward to be Mrs.
    Jenkings.&mdash;She had a handkerchief to her eyes, one hand lifted up;&mdash;and I
    heard her say, Good God! Sir, what shall I do?&mdash;how can I see the dear
    Ladies?&mdash;Oh Miss Powis!&mdash;the amiable Miss Powis!</p>
    <p>Mr. Morgan join'd us immediately, with whom and Mr. Watson I spent the remainder
    of this melancholy evening: at twelve we retir'd.</p>
    <p>So here I sit, like one just return'd from the funeral of his best
    friend;&mdash;alone, brooding over every misery I can call together.&mdash;The light
    of the moon, which shines with uncommon splendor, casts not one ray on my dark
    reflections:&mdash;nor do the objects which present themselves from the windows offer
    one pleasing idea;&mdash;rather an aggravation to my heart-felt
    anguish.&mdash;Miserable family!&mdash;miserable those who are interested in its sad
    disaster!&mdash;</p>
    <p>I go to my bed, but not to my repose.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Nine o'clock in the morning.</p>
    <p>How sad, how gloomy, has been the approach of morning!&mdash;About six, for I had
    not clos'd my eyes,&mdash;somebody enter'd my chamber. I suppos'd it Mr. Morgan, and
    drew aside my curtain.&mdash;It was not Mr. Morgan;&mdash;it <i>was</i> the poor
    disconsolate father of Miss Powis, more agitated, if possible, than the preceding
    night.&mdash;He flung himself on my bed with agony not to be express'd:&mdash;</p>
    <p>Dear Risby, said he, <i>do</i> rise:&mdash;<i>do</i> come to my
    apartment.&mdash;Alas! my Fanny&mdash;</p>
    <p>What new misfortune, my friend? ask'd I, starting up.&mdash;My wife! return'd!
    he!&mdash;she is in fits;&mdash;she has been in fits the whole night.&mdash;Oh Risby!
    if I should lose <i>her</i>, if I should lose my <i>wife!</i>&mdash;My parents
    <i>too</i>, I shall lose them!&mdash;</p>
    <p>Words could not lessen his affliction. I was silent, making what haste I could to
    huddle on my clothes;&mdash;and at his repeated intreaties follow'd him to his
    wife,&mdash;She was sitting near the fire drowned; in tears, supported by her woman.
    I was pleas'd to see them drop so plentifully.&mdash;She lifted up her head a little,
    as I enter'd.&mdash;How alter'd!&mdash;how torn to pieces with grief!&mdash;Her
    complexion once so lovely,&mdash;how changed in a few hours.</p>
    <p>My husband! said she, in a faint voice, as he drew near her.&mdash;Then looking at
    me,&mdash;Comfort him, Mr. Risby;&mdash;don't let him sob so.&mdash;Indeed he will be
    ill;&mdash;indeed he will.&mdash;Then addressing him, Consider, she who us'd to be
    your nurse is now incapable of the task.&mdash;His agitation was so much increas'd by
    her words and manner, that I attempted to draw him into another apartment.&mdash;Your
    intentions are kind, said she, Mr. Risby;&mdash;but I <i>must</i> not lose my
    husband:&mdash;you see how it is, Sir, shaking her head;&mdash;try to sooth
    him;&mdash;talk to him <i>here</i> but do not take him from <i>me</i>.&mdash;</p>
    <p>Then turning to Mr. Powis,&mdash;I am better, my love,&mdash;don't frighten
    yourself:&mdash;we must learn to be resign'd.&mdash;Set the example, and I will be
    resign'd, said he,&mdash;wiping away the tears as they trickled down her
    cheek;&mdash;if my Fanny supports herself, I shall not be quite miserable. In this
    situation I left them, to close my letter.</p>
    <p>What is become of poor Lord Darcey? For ever is he in my
    thoughts.&mdash;<i>His</i> death will be an aggravation to the general
    sorrow.&mdash;Write instantly:&mdash;I wait your account with impatience; yet dread
    to receive it.</p>

    <h2>LETTER XXXII</h2>
    <p>Captain RISBY to the Honourable GEORGE MOLESWORTH.</p>
    <p><i>Barford Abbey</i>.</p>
    <br />

    <p>My heart bleeds afresh&mdash;Her body found! Good heaven!&mdash;it <i>must</i>
    not,&mdash;<i>shall</i> not come to the knowledge of the family.&mdash;At present
    they submit with a degree of resignation.&mdash;Who knows but a latent hope might
    remain?&mdash;Instances have been known of many saved from wrecks;&mdash;but her body
    is drove on shore.&mdash;Not a glimmering;&mdash;possibility is <i>now</i> out of the
    question.&mdash;The family are determin'd to shut themselves out from the
    world;&mdash;no company ever more to be admitted;&mdash;never to go any where but to
    the church.&mdash;Your letter was deliver'd me before them.&mdash;I was ask'd
    tenderly for poor Lord Darcey.&mdash;What could I answer?&mdash;Near the same; not
    worse, on the whole.&mdash;They flatter themselves he will recover;&mdash;I encourage
    all their flattering hopes.</p>
    <p>Mrs. Jenkings has never been home since Mr. Morgan fetch'd her;&mdash;Mr. Jenkings
    too is constantly here;&mdash;sometimes Edmund:&mdash;except the unhappy parents,
    never was grief like theirs.</p>
    <p>Mr. Jenkings has convinc'd me it was Miss Powis which I saw at &mdash;&mdash;.
    Strange reverse of fortune since that hour!</p>
    <p>When the family are retir'd I spend many melancholy hours with poor
    Edmund;&mdash;and from him have learnt the reason why Mr. Powis conceal'd his
    marriage,&mdash;which is <i>now</i> no secret.&mdash;Even Edmund never knew it till
    Mr. and Mrs. Powis return'd to England,&mdash;Take a short recital:&mdash;it will
    help to pass away a gloomy moment.</p>
    <p>When Mr. Powis left the University, he went for a few months to Ireland with the
    Lord-Lieutenant; and at his return intended to make the Grand Tour.&mdash;In the mean
    time, Sir James and Lady Powis contract an intimacy with a young Lady of quality, in
    the bloom of life, but not of beauty.&mdash;By what I can gather, Lady Mary Sutton is
    plain to a degree,&mdash;with a mind&mdash;But why speak of her mind?&mdash;let that
    speak for itself.</p>
    <p>She was independent; her fortune noble;&mdash;her affections disengag'd.&mdash;Mr.
    Powis returns from Ireland: Lady Mary is then at the Abbey.&mdash;Sir James in a few
    days, without consulting his son, sues for her alliance.&mdash;Lady Mary supposes it
    is with the concurrence of Mr. Powis:&mdash;<i>his</i> person,&mdash;<i>his</i>
    character,&mdash;<i>his</i> family, were unexceptionable; and generously she declar'd
    her sentiments in his favour.&mdash;Sir James, elated with success, flies to his
    son;&mdash;and in presence of Lady Powis, tells him he has secur'd his
    happiness.&mdash;Mr. Powis's inclinations not coinciding,&mdash;Sir James throws
    himself into a violent rage.&mdash;Covetousness and obstinacy always go hand in
    hand:&mdash;both had taken such fast hold of the Baronet, that he swore&mdash;and his
    oath was without reservation&mdash;he would never consent to his son's marrying any
    other woman.&mdash;Mr. Powis, finding his father determin'd,&mdash;and nothing, after
    his imprecation, to expect from the entreaties of his mother,&mdash;strove to forget
    the person of Lady Mary, and think only of her mind.&mdash;Her Ladyship, a little
    chagrin'd Sir James's proposals were not seconded by Mr. Powis, pretended immediate
    business into Oxfordshire.&mdash;The Baronet wants not discernment: he saw through
    her motive; and taking his opportunity, insinuated the violence of his son's passion,
    and likewise the great timidity it occasion'd&mdash;he even prevail'd on Lady Powis
    to propose returning with her to Brandon Lodge.</p>
    <p>The consequence of this was, the two Ladies set out on their journey, attended by
    Sir James and Mr. Powis, who, in obedience to his father, was still endeavouring to
    conquer his indifference.&mdash;</p>
    <p>Perhaps, <i>in time</i>, the amiable Lady Mary might have found a way to his
    heart,&mdash;had she not introduc'd the very evening of their arrival at the Lodge,
    her counter-part in every thing but person:&mdash;there Miss Whitmore outshone her
    whole sex.&mdash;This fair neighbour was the belov'd friend of Lady Mary Sutton, and
    soon became the idol of Mr. Powis's affections, which render'd his situation still
    more distressing.&mdash;His mother's disinterested tenderness for Lady
    Mary;&mdash;her own charming qualifications;&mdash;his father's irrevocable menace,
    commanded him one way:&mdash;Miss Whitmore's charms led him another.</p>
    <p>Attached as he was to this young Lady, he never appear'd to take the least notice,
    of her more than civility demanded;&mdash;tho' she was of the highest consequence to
    his repose, yet the obstacles which surrounded him seem'd insurmountable.</p>
    <p>Sir James and Lady Powis retiring one evening earlier than usual,&mdash;Lady Mary
    and Mr. Powis were left alone. The latter appear'd greatly embarrass'd. Her Ladyship
    eyed him attentively; but instead of sharing his embarrassment,&mdash;began a
    conversation of which Miss Whitmore was the subject.&mdash;She talk'd <i>so</i> long
    of her many excellencies, profess'd <i>such</i> sincerity, <i>such</i> tenderness,
    <i>for her</i>, that his emotion became visible:&mdash;his fine, eyes were full of
    fire;&mdash;his expressive features spoke what she, had long wish'd to
    discover.&mdash;You are silent, Sir, said she, with a smile of ineffable sweetness;
    is my lovely friend a subject that displeases you?&mdash;</p>
    <p>How am I situated! replied he&mdash;Generous Lady Mary, dare I repose a confidence
    in your noble breast?&mdash;<i>Will</i> you permit me that honour?&mdash;<i>Will</i>
    you not think ill of me, if I disclose&mdash;No, I cannot&mdash;presumption&mdash;I
    <i>dare</i> not. She interrupted him:</p>
    <p>Ah Sir!&mdash;you hold me unworthy,&mdash;you hold me incapable of
    friendship.&mdash;Suppose me your sister:&mdash;if you had a sister, would you
    conceal any thing from <i>her?</i>&mdash;Give me then a <i>brother</i>;&mdash;I can
    never behold <i>you</i> in any other light.</p>
    <p>No, my Lady;&mdash;no, return'd he, I deserve not <i>this</i> honour.&mdash;If you
    knew, madam,&mdash;if you knew all,&mdash;you <i>would</i>, you <i>must</i> despise
    me.</p>
    <p>Despise you, Mr. Powis!&mdash;she replied;&mdash;despise you for loving Miss
    Whitmore!</p>
    <p>Exalted goodness! said he,&mdash;approaching her with rapture: take my
    heart;&mdash;do with it as you please;&mdash;it is devoted to your generosity.</p>
    <p>Well then, said she, I command <i>it</i>,&mdash;I command <i>it</i> instantly to
    be laid open before me.&mdash;<i>Now</i> let it speak,&mdash;<i>now</i> let it
    declare if I am not the bar to its felicity:&mdash;if&mdash;</p>
    <p>No, my good angel, interrupted he, dropping on his knees,&mdash;and pressing her
    hand to his lips;&mdash;I see it is through you,&mdash;through you only,&mdash;I am
    to expect felicity.</p>
    <p>Before Lady Mary could prevail on Mr. Powis to arise, Sir James, whom they did not
    expect,&mdash;and who they thought was retir'd for the night, came in quest of his
    snuff-box;&mdash;but with a countenance full of joy retir'd precipitately, bowing to
    Lady Mary with the same reverence as if she had been a molten image cast of his
    favourite metal.</p>
    <p>In this conversation I have been circumstantial, that you might have a full view
    of the noble, disinterested Lady Mary Sutton:&mdash;you may gather now, from whence
    sprang her unbounded affection for the incomparable, unfortunate Miss Powis.</p>
    <p>You will not be surprised to find a speedy marriage took place between Mr. Powis
    and Miss Whitmore, to which none were privy but the Dean of H&mdash;&mdash;, who
    perform'd the ceremony,&mdash;Lady Mary,&mdash;Mrs. Whitmore (the mother of Mrs.
    Powis),&mdash;Mr. and Mrs. Jenkings.&mdash;Perhaps you think Lady Powis ought to have
    been consulted:&mdash;I thought so <i>too</i>; but am <i>now</i> convinc'd she would
    have been the wretchedest woman in the world, had she known her son acting
    diametrically opposite to the will of his father in so material a point.</p>
    <p>To put it out of the power of every person intrusted with this momentous secret to
    divulge it,&mdash;and to make Mr. Powis perfectly easy,&mdash;each bound themselves
    at the altar where the ceremony was perform'd, never to make the least discovery
    'till Mr. Powis thought fit to declare his marriage.</p>
    <p>What an instance have I given you of <i>female</i> friendship!&mdash;Shew me such
    another:&mdash;our sex are a test of <i>their</i> friendships.</p>
    <p>How many girls have I seen,&mdash;for ever together arm in arm,&mdash;whispering
    their own, perhaps the secrets of all their neighbours;&mdash;when in steps a young
    fellow of our cloth,&mdash;or any other, it signifies not the colour,&mdash;and down
    tumbles the tottering basis.&mdash;Instead of <i>my dear</i> and <i>my love</i>, it
    is <i>sly creature, false friend</i>, could any one have thought Miss Such-a-one
    possess'd of so much art?&mdash;then out comes intrigues, family-affairs, losses at
    cards,&mdash;in short, every thing that has been treasur'd up by two industrious fair
    ones seven years before.</p>
    <p>Don't think me satyrical:&mdash;I am nice;&mdash;<i>too</i> much so,
    perhaps.&mdash;The knowledge of <i>such</i> as constitute this little narrative, and
    <i>some</i> other minds like <i>theirs</i>, has made me rather <i>too</i> nice, as I
    said before;&mdash;a matter of little consequence, as I am situated.&mdash;Can I look
    forward to happy prospects, and see how soon the fairest felicity is out of
    sight?&mdash;This afflicted family, Molesworth, has taught me to forget,&mdash;that
    is, I ought to forget.&mdash;But no matter;&mdash;never again let me see Lady
    Sophia;&mdash;never lead me a second time into danger:&mdash;she is mortal; like Miss
    Powis.&mdash;Lord Darcey! poor Lord Darcey!</p>
    <p>If recollection will assist me, a word or two more of Mr. and Mrs. Powis.</p>
    <p>Lady Sophia&mdash;the deuce is in me! you know who I mean;&mdash;why write I the
    name of Lady Sophia?&mdash;upon my honour, I have given over all thoughts of that
    divinity&mdash;Lady Mary I should have said, a few months after the nuptials of her
    friends, wrote to Mr. Powis, who was then at Barford Abbey, an absolute refusal, in
    consequence of a preconcerned plan of operation.&mdash;Immediately after this, she
    set out with Mrs. Powis for London, whose <i>situation</i> made it necessary for her
    to leave Hillford Down.</p>
    <p>You will suppose, on the receipt of this letter, how matters were at the
    Abbey:&mdash;Sir. James rav'd; even Lady Powis thought her son ill us'd; but, in
    consideration of their former intimacy, prevail'd on Sir James never to mention the
    affair, though from this time all acquaintance ceas'd between the families.</p>
    <p>In order to conceal the marriage, it was inevitable Mr. Powis must carry his wife
    abroad;&mdash;and as he intended to travel before the match was thought of with Lady
    Mary,&mdash;his father now readily consented that he should begin his
    tour.&mdash;This furnish'd him with an excuse to go immediately to town,&mdash;where
    he waited 'till the angel that we all weep for, made her appearance.</p>
    <p>But what, you ask, was Mrs. Powis's excuse to leave England, without being
    suspected?&mdash;Why, I'll tell you: by the contrivance of Lady Mary, together with
    Mrs. Whitmore, it was believ'd she had left the world;&mdash;that she died in town of
    a malignant fever;&mdash;that&mdash;but I cannot be circumstantial&mdash;Miss Powis,
    after her parents went abroad, was brought down by Lady Mary, and consign'd to the
    care of her grandmother, with whom she liv'd as the orphan child of some distant
    relation.</p>
    <p>Whilst Mr. and Mrs. Powis were travelling through Italy, he apply'd to his friend
    the Lord-Lieutenant,&mdash;and by <i>that</i> interest was appointed to the
    government of &mdash;&mdash;. It was here my acquaintance with them commenc'd: not
    that I suspected Miss Glinn to be Mrs. Powis, though I saw her every
    day.&mdash;<i>Glinn</i> was a name she assum'd 'till she returned to England.&mdash;A
    thousand little circumstances which render'd her character unsuspected, I want
    spirits to relate.&mdash;Suffice it to say,&mdash;the death of Mrs. Whitmore;&mdash;a
    daughter passing on the world for an orphan;&mdash;and the absence of Lady Mary
    Sutton;&mdash;made them resolve to hazard every thing rather than leave their child
    unprotected.&mdash;Alas! for what are they come home?</p>
    <p>Nothing is impossible with a Supreme Being.&mdash;Lord Darcey <i>may</i>
    recover.&mdash;But why this ray of hope to make the horrors of my mind more
    dreadful?&mdash;He is <i>past</i> hope, you say.&mdash;</p>

    <h2>LETTER XXXVI.</h2>
    <p>The Honourable GEORGE MOLESWORTH to RICHARD RISBY, Esq;</p>
    <p><i>Dover</i>.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Darcey bears the joyful surprise beyond imagination:&mdash;it has brought him from
    death to life.&mdash;</p>
    <p>Hear in what manner I proceeded;&mdash;You may suppose the hurry in which I left
    Dover:&mdash;I took no leave of my friend;&mdash;his humane apothecary promis'd not
    to quit him in my absence:&mdash;I gave orders when his Lordship enquir'd for me,
    that he should be told particular business of my <i>own</i> had call'd me to town
    express.&mdash;It happen'd very convenient that I left him in a profound sleep.</p>
    <p>Away I flew,&mdash;agitated betwixt <i>hope</i> and <i>fear</i>:&mdash;harrass'd
    by fatigue;&mdash;not in a bed for three nights before;&mdash;nature was almost wore
    out, when I alighted at the banker's.</p>
    <p>I accosted one of the clerks, desiring to speak with Mr. or Mrs. Delves<a
    id="FNanchor_A_1" name='FNanchor_A_1'></a><a
    href='#Footnote_A_1'><sup>[A]</sup></a>:&mdash;the former not at home, I was
    immediately conducted to the latter, a genteel woman, about forty.&mdash;She receiv'd
    me politely; but before I could acquaint her with the occasion of my visit, the door
    open'd, and in stepp'd a pretty sprightly girl, who on seeing me was going to
    retire.&mdash;Do you want any thing, my love? said Mrs. Delves. Only, Madam, she
    replied, if you think it proper for Miss Warley to get up.</p>
    <a id="Footnote_A_1" name='Footnote_A_1'></a><a href='#FNanchor_A_1'>[A]</a>
    <div class='note'>
      <p>The name of the banker.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Miss Warley! exclaim'd I.&mdash;Great God! Miss Warley!&mdash;Tell me, Ladies, is
    Miss Warley <i>really</i> under your roof?&mdash;Both at once, for <i>both</i> seem'd
    equally dispos'd to diffuse happiness, answer'd to my wishes.</p>
    <p>I threw myself back in my chair:&mdash;the surprise was more than I could
    support.&mdash;Shall I tell you all my weakness?&mdash;I even shed tears;&mdash;yes,
    Dick, I shed tears:&mdash;but they were drops of heart-felt gladness.</p>
    <p>The Ladies look'd on each other,&mdash;Mrs. Delves said in a tone that shew'd she
    was not without the darling passion of her sex,</p>
    <p>Pardon me, Sir; I think I have heard Miss Warley has <i>no</i> brother,&mdash;or I
    should think <i>your</i> emotion I saw him before me.&mdash;But whoever you are, this
    humanity is noble.&mdash;Indeed, the poor young Lady has been extremely ill.</p>
    <p>I am not her brother, Madam, return'd I.&mdash;It is true, she has <i>no</i>
    brother;&mdash;but <i>she has</i> parents, <i>she has</i> friends, who lament her
    dead:&mdash;<i>their</i> sorrow has been <i>mine</i>.</p>
    <p>I fear, Sir, return'd she, it will not end here.&mdash;I grieve to tell you, the
    Miss Warley you speak of is not with me;&mdash;I know nothing of that Lady:&mdash;my
    Miss Warley has no parents.</p>
    <p>I still persisted it was the same; and, to the no small gratification of both
    mother and daughter, promis'd to explain the mystery.&mdash;But before I began, Miss
    Delves was sent to desire Miss Warley would continue in bed an hour longer, on
    account of some visitors that had dropp'd in accidentally.</p>
    <p>Soon as Miss Delves return'd, I related every particular.&mdash;I cannot tell you
    half that pass'd;&mdash;I cannot describe their astonishment:&mdash;but let me
    <i>tell</i> you Miss Powis is just recover'd from the small-pox;&mdash;that this was
    the second day of her sitting up:&mdash;let me <i>tell</i> you <i>too</i> her face is
    as beautiful as ever.&mdash;On mature deliberation, it was determin'd, for the sake
    of Miss Powis's health, she must some time longer think her name Warley.</p>
    <p>I din'd with my new acquaintance, on their promising to procure an interview for
    me with Miss Powis in the afternoon.</p>
    <p>It was about five when I was admitted to her presence.&mdash;I found her in an
    elegant dressing-room, sitting on a sopha: her head a little reclin'd.&mdash;I
    stepp'd slow and softly: she arose as I enter'd.&mdash;I wonder not that Darcey
    adores her, never was a form so perfect!</p>
    <p>My trembling knees beat one against another.&mdash;My heart,&mdash;my impatient
    heart flew up to my face to tell its joyful sensations.&mdash;I ventur'd to press her
    hand to my lips, but was incapable of pronouncing a syllable.&mdash;She was
    confus'd:&mdash;she certainly thought of Darcey, when she saw his friend.&mdash;I
    took a chair next her.&mdash;I shall not repeat our conversation 'till it became
    interesting, which began by her asking, if I had heard lately any accounts from
    Barford Abbey?&mdash;Lord Darcey, Madam, I reply'd, has receiv'd a letter from Sir
    James.</p>
    <p>Lord Darcey! she repeated with great emotion.&mdash;Is Sir James and Lady Powis
    well. Sir?</p>
    <p>His Lordship, reply'd I, awkwardly, did not mention particulars.&mdash;I
    believe,&mdash;I suppose.&mdash;your friends are well.</p>
    <p>I fear, said she sighing, they will think me an ungrateful creature.&mdash;No
    person, Mr. Molesworth, had ever <i>such</i> obligations to their friends as <i>I
    have</i>&mdash;This family, looking at the two Ladies, must be rank'd with my
    best.&mdash;Their replies were polite and affectionate&mdash;Can you tell me, Sir,
    continued she, if Lord&mdash;here her face was all over crimson&mdash;heavens! I
    mean, if Mr. Powis and his Lady are at the Abbey?&mdash;Why did she not say Lord
    Darcey? I swear the name quiver'd on her lips.</p>
    <p>I answer'd in the affirmative;&mdash;and sitting silent a moment,&mdash;she ask'd
    how I discover'd her to be still in England.&mdash;I said by means of a
    servant:&mdash;true enough, Dick:&mdash;but then I was oblig'd to add, this servant
    belonged to Mr. Delves, and that he accidentally happen'd a few hours since to
    mention her name whilst I was doing business in the shop.&mdash;She was fond of
    dwelling on the family at the Abbey;&mdash;on Mr. and Mrs. Jenkings;&mdash;and once
    when I mention'd my friend, when I said how happy I should make him at my
    return;&mdash;pleasure, the most difficult to be conceal'd of any sensation, sprang
    to her expressive eyes.</p>
    <p>I suppose she will expect a visit from his Lordship.&mdash;If she is angry at
    being disappointed, no matter: the mistake will be soon clear'd up.</p>
    <p>The moment I left her, I stepp'd into a chaise that waited for me at the door, and
    drove like lightning from stage to stage, 'till I reach'd this place;&mdash;my
    drivers being turn'd into Mercuries by a touch more efficacious than all the oaths
    that can be swore by a first-rate blood.</p>
    <p>I did not venture into Darcey's apartment 'till he was inform'd of my
    return.&mdash;I heard him impatiently ask to see me, as I stood without the door.
    This call'd me to him;&mdash;when pulling aside the curtain he ask'd, Who is
    that?&mdash;Is it Molesworth?&mdash;Are you come, my friend? But what have you
    seen?&mdash;what have you heard?&mdash;looking earnestly in face.&mdash;<i>I</i> am
    past joy,&mdash;past feeling pleasure even for you, George;&mdash;yet tell me why you
    look not so sorrowful as yesterday.&mdash;</p>
    <p>I ask'd what alteration it was he saw:&mdash;what it was he suspected.&mdash;When
    I have griev'd, my Lord, it has been for you.&mdash;If I am now less afflicted, you
    must be less miserable.&mdash;He started up in the bed, and grasping both my hands in
    his, cry'd. Tell me, Molesworth, is there a possibility,&mdash;a bare
    possibility?&mdash;I ask no more;&mdash;only tell me there is a possibility.</p>
    <p>My Lord,&mdash;my friend,&mdash;my Darcey, nothing is impossible.</p>
    <p>By heaven! he exclaim'd, you would not flatter me;&mdash;by heaven she lives!</p>
    <p>Ask me not farther, my Lord.&mdash;What is the blessing you most wish
    for?&mdash;Suppose that blessing granted.&mdash;And you, Risby, suppose the
    extasy,&mdash;the thankfulness that ensued.&mdash;He that is grateful to man, can he
    be ungrateful to his Maker?</p>
    <p>Yours,</p>

    <p>Think me not ungrateful, my ever-honour'd Lady, that I have been silent under the
    ten thousand obligations which I receiv'd at Barford Abbey.&mdash;But indeed, my dear
    Lady, I have been <i>very</i> ill.&mdash;I have had the small-pox:&mdash;I was seiz'd

    <h2>LETTER XXXVIII.</h2>
    <p>Miss Powis to Lady MARY SUTTON.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Oh my dear Lady! what a villain have I escap'd from?&mdash;Could your Ladyship
    believe that a man, who, to all appearance, has made a good husband to your agreeable
    neighbour upwards of twelve years, and preserv'd the character of a man of
    honour;&mdash;could you believe in the decline of life he would have fallen off? No,
    he cannot have fallen: such a mind as his never was exalted.&mdash;It is the virtues
    of his wife that has hitherto made his vices imperceptible;&mdash;that has kept them
    in their dark cell, afraid to venture out;&mdash;afraid to appear amidst her shining
    perfections.&mdash;Vile, abandon'd Smith!&mdash;But for the sake of his injur'd,
    unhappy wife, I will not discover his baseness to any but yourself and Lady
    Powis.&mdash;Perhaps Mrs. Smith may not be unacquainted with his innate bad
    principles;&mdash;perhaps she conceals her knowledge of them knowing it vain to
    complain of a disorder which is past the reach of medicine.&mdash;What cure is there
    for mischief lurking under the mask of hypocrisy?&mdash;It must be of long standing
    before that covering can grow over it:&mdash;like a vellum on the eye, though taken
    off ever skillfully, it will again spread on the blemish'd sight.</p>
    <p>How am I running on!&mdash;My spirits are flutter'd:&mdash;I begin where I should
    end, and end where I should begin.&mdash;Behold me, dearest Madam, just parted from
    my Hampshire friends,&mdash;silent and in tears, plac'd by the side of my miscreant
    conductor.&mdash;You know, my Lady, this specious man <i>can</i> make himself vastly
    entertaining: he strove to render his conversation particularly so, on our first
    setting out.</p>
    <p>We had travell'd several stages without varying the subject, which was that of our
    intended tour, when I said I hop'd it would conquer Mrs. Smith's melancholy for the
    death of her brother.&mdash;How did his answer change him in a moment from the
    <i>most</i> agreeable to the <i>most</i> disgustful of his sex!</p>
    <p>My wife, Miss Warley, with a leer that made him look dreadful, wants your charming
    sprightliness:&mdash;it is a curs'd thing to be connected with a gloomy
    woman:&mdash;</p>
    <p><i>Gloomy</i>, Sir! casting at him a look of disdain; do you call mildness,
    complacency, and evenness of temper, <i>gloomy?</i></p>
    <p>She is much altered, Madam;&mdash;is grown old and peevish;&mdash;her health is
    bad;&mdash;she cannot live long.</p>
    <p>Mrs. Smith can never be <i>peevish</i>, Sir;&mdash;and as to her <i>age</i>, I
    thought it pretty near your <i>own</i>.</p>
    <p>No, no, Madam, you are quite mistaken; I am at least five years younger.</p>
    <p>Five years, Sir! what are five years at <i>your</i> time of life!</p>
    <p>Come, come, Miss Warley, laying his huge paw on my hand, and in a tone of voice
    that shew'd him heartily nettled;&mdash;even at <i>my</i> time of life I can admire a
    beautiful young Lady.&mdash;If my wife should die,&mdash;<i>old as I am</i>&mdash;men
    <i>older</i> than myself, with half my estate, have married some of the finest women
    in the kingdom.</p>
    <p>Very likely, Sir;&mdash;but then it is to be suppos'd the characters of
    <i>such</i> men have been particularly amiable,&mdash;No man or woman of honour can
    esteem another whose principles are doubtful.</p>
    <p>This was a pretty home-thrust; it put him more on his guard for the present; but
    had he behav'd like an angel, I must have hated him. He was <i>very</i> respectful,
    <i>very</i> ceremonious, and <i>very</i> thoughtful, 'till we arrived at the inn
    where we were to stop the night; and had so much art not to seem displeas'd, that I
    refus'd giving him my company at supper, under pretence of
    indisposition.&mdash;Indeed, I was far from well: a child which I had seen a few
    hours before fresh in the small-pox, a good deal disconcerted me.&mdash;After fixing
    on my room, not to appear suspicious, I went down at his request, to eat a bit of
    cake and drink a glass of wine, before I retired for the night.&mdash;I had scarce
    swallow'd it when he left me, as he said, to speak to the drivers. I wished him a
    good night as he went out, and took an opportunity a few moments after to go to my
    chamber.&mdash;When there I lock'd the door, and sat myself down to undress; but I
    began to be greatly alarm'd by something that mov'd under the bed.&mdash;Judge my
    surprize,&mdash;judge my horror,&mdash;on taking the candle and examining, to see
    there a man!&mdash;But how was that surprize,&mdash;that horror increased, on
    discovering, him to be the vile Smith!&mdash;I gave a loud scream, and ran towards
    the door; but had not power to turn the key, before he caught me in his
    arms.&mdash;</p>
    <p>Be calm, Miss Warley, cried the monster;&mdash;hear what I have to
    say.&mdash;Suffer me to tell you, that I love you to distraction;&mdash;that I adore
    you.</p>
    <p><i>Adore</i> me, vile man! said I, breaking from him:&mdash;leave me this
    instant&mdash;begone:&mdash;leave me, I say, instantly.&mdash;Again I scream'd.</p>
    <p>No, by heaven! he reply'd, I will not go 'till you have heard and pardon'd
    me.&mdash;Here I stand <i>determin'd</i> to be heard:&mdash;<i>hear</i> me, or this
    moment is my last.&mdash;With that he drew out a pistol, and held it to his
    breast.</p>
    <p>And <i>dare</i> you, said I, collecting all my resolution,&mdash;<i>dare</i> you
    rush into eternity, without one virtue to offer up with your polluted soul?&mdash;I
    pronounc'd these words with steadiness.&mdash;<i>He</i> trembled, he look'd like a
    criminal at the hour of execution.&mdash;Letting the pistol drop from his hand, the
    base dissembler fell on his knees before me.&mdash;Nobody hearing my
    cries,&mdash;nobody coming to my assistance, I was oblig'd to hear, and pretend to
    credit his penitential protestations. God knows how my ears might have been farther
    shock'd with his odious passion;&mdash;what indignities I might have
    suffer'd,&mdash;had I not heard some person passing by the door of my
    apartment:&mdash;on which I ventur'd to give another scream.&mdash;The door was
    instantly burst open; and whilst an elderly Gentleman advanc'd towards me, full of
    surprize, the detested brute slipp'd away.&mdash;This Gentleman, my good deliverer,
    was no other than your Ladyship's banker, who when he was acquainted with my name,
    insisted on taking me to Town in his own coach, where he was returning from a visit
    he had made at Salisbury&mdash;I did not ask, neither do I know what became of Smith;
    but I suppose he will set out with his wife immediately for Dover.&mdash;Thank God! I
    am not of the party&mdash;How I pity poor Miss Frances Walsh, a young Lady who, he
    told me, was waiting at his house in Town to go over with them.&mdash;I am but just
    arriv'd at Mr. Delves's house.&mdash;Mr. and Mrs. Delves think with me, that the
    character of the <i>unworthy</i> Smith should not be expos'd for the sake of his
    <i>worthy</i> wife.&mdash;The family here are all amiable.&mdash;I could say a great
    deal more; but my head aches dreadfully.&mdash;This I must add, I have consented, at
    the tender intreaties of Mr. and Mrs. Delves, to remain with them 'till a proper
    opportunity offers to throw myself at your Ladyship's feet.&mdash;My head grows
    worse;&mdash;I must lay down my pen.&mdash;This bad man has certainly frighten'd me
    into a fever.</p>
    <p>[The following lines were added after Miss Powis's recovery]</p>
    <p>I hope, my dear Lady, before this you have Mr. Delves's letter;&mdash;if so, you
    know I have had the small-pox.&mdash;You know too I am out of danger.&mdash;How can I
    be thankful enough for so many escapes!&mdash;This is the first day I have been able
    to hold a pen.&mdash;I am permitted to write no more than the name of your honour'd

    sheet?&mdash;No:&mdash;Was I to repeat half,&mdash;only half of what they send, you,
    I might write on for ever.&mdash;One says you shall be their son;&mdash;another,
    their brother;&mdash;a third, that you are a man most favour'd of heaven&mdash;but
    all agree, as a reward for your virtues you are impower'd to heal
    afflictions&mdash;in short, they want to make me think you can make black
    white&mdash;But enough for the vanity of one man.</p>
    <p>I dread your coming to the Abbey.&mdash;We that are here already, shall only,
    then, appear like pismires:&mdash;but let me caution my friend not to think his head
    will touch the clouds.</p>
    <p>What man can bear to be twice disinherited?&mdash;Mr. Morgan's estate, which the
    other day I was solely to possess, is now to devolve on the Honourable George
    Molesworth.&mdash;<i>But mark me</i>:&mdash;As I have been disinherited for
    you,&mdash;<i>you</i> as certainly will be disinherited for Lord Darcey.</p>
    <p>See what a man of consequence I am.&mdash;Does Captain Risby say
    <i>this?</i>&mdash;Does Captain Risby say <i>that?</i>&mdash;Does Captain Risby think
    well of it?</p>
    <p>Expect, George, to behold me push'd into perferment against my will;&mdash;all
    great people <i>say</i> so, you know;&mdash;expect to behold me preside as governor
    of this castle.&mdash;Let me enjoy it then,&mdash;let me plume myself beneath the
    sun-beam.</p>
    <p>If to witness the honours with I am surrounded, is insufficient to fill your
    expanded heart;&mdash;if it looks out for a warmer gratification; you shall see, you
    shall hear, the exulting parents?&mdash;you shall see Mr. Morgan revers'd;&mdash;Mr.
    Watson restor'd to <i>more</i> than sight&mdash;the steward and his family worthy
    every <i>honour</i> they receive from this <i>honourable house</i>.</p>
    <p>I hear my <i>shadow</i>.&mdash;Strange, indeed! to hear <i>shadows</i>;&mdash;but
    more so to hear them swear.&mdash;Ha! ha! ha!&mdash;Ha! ha! ha!&mdash;I cannot speak
    to it for laughing.&mdash;Coming, Sir!&mdash;coming, Mr. Morgan!&mdash;Now is he
    cursing me in every corner of the house;&mdash;I suppose dinner is on the table.</p>
    <p>This moment return'd from regaling myself with the happy family:&mdash;I mean Sir
    James and Lady Powis, with their joyful inmates.&mdash;Mr. and Mrs. Powis are set out
    for London.&mdash;As an addition to their felicity, Lady Powis had a letter from her
    grand-daughter the instant they were stepping into the chaise.</p>
    <p>For one hour I am at your command:&mdash;take, then, the particulars which I was
    incapable of giving you by John.&mdash;</p>
    <p>I was sitting in the library-window, talking to Mr. Watson; the Ladies, Sir James,
    and Mr. Morgan, in the dressing-room, when I saw John riding down the great road a
    full gallop.&mdash;At first I thought Lord Darcey had been dead; then, again,
    consider'd his faithful servant would not have come post with the
    news:&mdash;however, I had not patience to go through the house, but lifting up a
    sash, jump'd out before he could reach the stable yard.&mdash;Without speaking, I
    enquired of his face what tidings; and was answer'd by a broad grin. I had nothing to
    fear from his message.</p>
    <p>Well, John, said I, running up to him,&mdash;how is your Lord? how is Mr.
    Molesworth?&mdash;</p>
    <p>Better, I thank God, Sir;&mdash;better, I thank God! With that he turned his
    horse, and was riding across the lawn.&mdash;</p>
    <p>Zounds, John, where are you going?&mdash;where are you going?</p>
    <p>Follow me, Sir;&mdash;follow me (setting up a brisk trot). If you kill me, I dare
    not deliver letter or message before we are at a distance from the Abbey.</p>
    <p>I thought him mad, but kept on by the side of his horse 'till we came to the gate
    of a meadow, where he dismounted.</p>
    <p>Now, Sir,' said he, with a look that bespoke his consequence,&mdash;have patience,
    whilst I tie up my horse.</p>
    <p><i>Patience</i>, John! (and I swore at him) I am out of all <i>patience</i>.</p>
    <p>With that he condescended to deliver your letters.&mdash;I rambled with surprise
    at the contents, and fell against a hedge.&mdash;John, who by this time had fasten'd
    his steed, came up to me just as I recover'd my legs;&mdash;and speaking close to my
    ear,&mdash;'Twas <i>John Warren</i>, Sir, was the <i>man</i> who found out the Lady;
    'twas I was the <i>man</i>, Sir.</p>
    <p>I shook him heartily by the hand, but for my soul could not utter a
    syllable.&mdash;I hope you are not ill, Sir, said the poor fellow, thinking me seiz'd
    speechless.&mdash;</p>
    <p>No, John;&mdash;no, reply'd I; it is only excess of pleasure.&mdash;You are a
    welcome messenger:&mdash;you have made your fortune, John Warren, and please your
    honour, has made his dear Lord happy;&mdash;that is more <i>pleasurable</i> to him
    than all the riches in the world.</p>
    <p>You are an honest, good creature, John.</p>
    <p>Ay, Captain; but was it not very sensible to remember the young Lady's
    hand-writing?&mdash;Would a powder-headed monkey have had the forecast?</p>
    <p>Oh very sensible, John;&mdash;very sensible, indeed!&mdash;Now go the
    Abbey;&mdash;ask for my servant;&mdash;say you was sent by Mr. Molesworth to enquire
    for the family; but do not mention you have seen me:&mdash;I shall return by a
    different way.</p>
    <p>John mounted immediately, and I walk'd full speed towards the house. I found Mr.
    Morgan taking long strides up and down the dining-parlour, puffing, blowing, and
    turning his wig on every side.</p>
    <p>Where have you been, Captain? I have sent to seek you.&mdash;Lord Darcey's servant
    is without;&mdash;come to enquire how things are <i>here</i>.&mdash;I would not let
    them send his message up;&mdash;but I have been out myself to ask for his
    Lordship.</p>
    <p>Well, Sir, and what says the servant?</p>
    <p>Says!&mdash;Faith I hardly know what he says&mdash;something about hopes of
    him:&mdash;to be plain, I should think it better if <i>hope</i> was out of the
    question.&mdash;If <i>he</i> and all of <i>us</i> were dead&mdash;But see John
    yourself; I will send him to you.</p>
    <p>As he was just without the door, I drew him back,&mdash;and turn'd the
    key.&mdash;</p>
    <p>Come hither, Sir;&mdash;Come hither, Mr. Morgan:&mdash;I have something of
    importance to communicate.</p>
    <p>D&mdash;&mdash;n ye, Captain, what's the matter now? (staring.)&mdash;I'll hear no
    more bad news:&mdash;upon my soul, I'll run out of it (attempting to open the
    door).</p>
    <p>Hold, Sir; why this impatience?&mdash;Miss Powis <i>lives!</i>&mdash;Will you run
    from me now?&mdash;Miss Powis <i>lives!</i>&mdash;With that he sent forth a horrid
    noise;&mdash;something betwixt howling and screaming.&mdash;It reach'd the
    dressing-room, as well it might:&mdash;had the wind sat that way, I question if the
    village would not have been alarm'd.&mdash;Down ran Sir James and Mr. Powis into the
    library;&mdash;out jump'd Mr. Morgan.&mdash;I held up my hand for him to
    retreat:&mdash;he disregarding the caution, I follow'd.&mdash;Sir James was inquiring
    of a servant whence the noise had proceeded.</p>
    <p>It was I, said Mr. Morgan, rubbing his sides, and expressing the agitation of joy
    by dumb shew;&mdash;it was I, beating one of my damn'd dogs for running up
    stairs.</p>
    <p>If that is all, said Mr. Powis,&mdash;let us return to my mother and wife, who are
    much hurried.&mdash;Away we went together, and the affair of the dog pass'd very well
    on the Ladies.</p>
    <p>I sat musing for some moments how to introduce the event my heart labour'd to give
    up.&mdash;<i>Every</i> sigh that escap'd,&mdash;<i>every</i> sorrowful look that was
    interchang'd, I <i>now</i> plac'd to my own account, because in <i>my</i> power to
    reverse the scene.</p>
    <p>Addressing myself to Mr. Powis, I ask'd if he knew Lord Darcey's servant was
    below.&mdash;He shook his head;&mdash;No, he answer'd.&mdash;Then it is all
    <i>over</i>, Risby, I suppose in a low voice?&mdash;I hardly wish for his <i>own</i>
    sake he may recover:&mdash;for <i>ours</i>, it would be selfish.</p>
    <p>He was not worse, I reply'd:&mdash;there was hope,&mdash;great hope he would do
    well.</p>
    <p>Blessings attend him! cried Mrs. Powis.&mdash;tears starting afresh to her swoln
    eyes;&mdash;then you really think, Mr. Risby, he may recover?</p>
    <p>If he does, Madam, return'd! he is flatter'd into life.&mdash;Flatter'd! said Mr.
    Powis eagerly;&mdash;how flatter'd?</p>
    <p>Why, continued I, he has been told some persons are sav'd from the wreck.</p>
    <p>Up they all started, surrounding me on every side:&mdash;there seem'd but one
    voice, yet each ask'd if I credited the report.</p>
    <p>I said I did.&mdash;</p>
    <p>Down they dropp'd on their knees, praying with uplifted hands their
    dear,&mdash;dear child may be of the number.&mdash;Though nothing could equal the
    solemnity of this scene, I could scarce command my countenance, when I saw Mr. Morgan
    standing in the midst of the circle, his hat held up before his face, and a cane
    under his arm.</p>
    <p>As they rose from their knees,&mdash;I gave them all the consolation I thought at
    that moment they were capable of sustaining;&mdash;and assur'd them no vigilance
    would be wanting to come at particulars.&mdash;I was ask'd, if there was any letter
    from Mr. Molesworth?&mdash;When answer'd in the affirmative,&mdash;the next question
    was, if it related to what I had just disclos'd?&mdash;I equivocated in my reply, and
    withdrew to write the few unconnected lines sent by John.</p>
    <p>After he was dispatch'd, I return'd immediately to the hopeing,&mdash;fearing
    family.&mdash;Mr. Watson was sitting amidst them:&mdash;he seem'd like a Being of
    purity presiding over hearts going to be rewarded for resignation to the Divine
    will.</p>
    <p>He heard me as I enter'd: he rose from his seat as I came near him, and pressing
    one of my hands between both his, whisper'd, I have seen Mr. Morgan.&mdash;Then
    raising his voice, You are the messenger of joy, Mr. Risby;&mdash;complete the
    happiness you have begun:&mdash;all present, pointing round, are prepar'd to receive
    it.</p>
    <p>Here drops my pen.&mdash;I must not attempt this scene:&mdash;a Shakespeare would
    have wrote it in tears.</p>
    <p>How infinite,&mdash;how dazzling the beauty of holiness!&mdash;Affliction seems to
    have threaten'd this amiable family, only to encrease their love,&mdash;their
    reverence,&mdash;their admiration of Divine Omnipotence.&mdash;Blessings may appear,
    as a certain great man remarks, under the shape of pain, losses, and
    disappointments;&mdash;but let us have patience, and we shall see them in their own
    proper figures.</p>
    <p>If rewards even in this world attend the <i>virtuous</i>, who would be
    <i>depraved?</i>&mdash;Could the loose, the abandon'd, look in on this happy mansion,
    how would their sensual appetites be pall'd!&mdash;How would they hate,&mdash;how
    detest the vanity,&mdash;the folly that leads to vice!&mdash;If pleasure is their
    pursuit, here they might see it speaking at <i>mouth</i> and
    <i>eyes</i>:&mdash;<i>pleasures</i> that fleet not away;&mdash;<i>pleasures</i> that
    are carried beyond the grave.</p>
    <p>What a family is this to take a wife from!&mdash;Lord Darcey's happiness is
    insur'd:&mdash;in my conscience, there will not be such another couple in
    England.</p>
    <p>Preparations are making to welcome the lovely successor of this ancient
    house;&mdash;preparations to rejoice those whose satisfactions are scanty,&mdash;to
    clothe the naked,&mdash;to feed the hungry,&mdash;to let the stately roof echo with
    songs and mirth from a croud of chearful, honest, old tenants.</p>
    <p>I often hear Mrs. Jenkings crying out in extasy,&mdash;My angel!&mdash;my sweet
    angel!&mdash;As to the old gentleman and Edmund, they actually cannot refrain from
    tears, when Miss Powis's name is mention'd.&mdash;Sir James and her Ladyship are
    never easy without these good folks.&mdash;It has ever been an observation of mine,
    that at an unexpected fortunate event, we are fond of having people about us who feel
    on the same passion.</p>
    <p>Mr. Morgan is quite his own man again:&mdash;he has been regaling himself with a
    fine hunt, whilst I attended Sir James and my Lady in an airing round the
    park.&mdash;After dinner we were acquainted with all his losses and crosses in the
    dog and horse way.&mdash;He had not seen <i>Filley</i> rubb'd down this
    fortnight:&mdash;the huntsman had lost three of his best hounds:&mdash;two spaniels
    were lame;&mdash;and one of his running horses glander'd.&mdash;He concluded with
    swearing, as things turn'd out, he did not matter it <i>much</i>;&mdash;but had it
    happen'd three weeks since; he should have drove all his servants to the
    devil.&mdash;Enough of Mr. Morgan.&mdash;Adieu, Molesworth!&mdash;Forget not my
    congratulations to your noble, happy, friend.</p>

    <p>The Honourable GEORGE MOLESWORTH</p>
    <p>to RICHARD RISBY, Esq;</p>
    <p><i>Dover</i>.</p>
    <br />

    <p>All is happiness, Dick!&mdash;I see nothing else; I hear of nothing else.&mdash;It
    is the <i>last</i> thing I take leave of at night;&mdash;the <i>first</i> thing I
    meet in the morning.&mdash;<i>Yesterday</i> was full of it!&mdash;<i>yesterday</i> I
    dined with Mr. and Mrs. Powis and their charming daughter, at the Banker's.&mdash;To
    look back, it seems as if I had gone through all the vexations of my life in the last
    three weeks.</p>
    <p>Darcey would not let me rest 'till I had been to congratulate them, or rather to
    satisfy his own impatience, being distracted to hear how Miss Powis bore the great
    discovery.&mdash;Her fortitude is amazing!&mdash;But Sir James has had every
    particular from his son, therefore I shall be too late on that subject.</p>
    <p>The following short epistle I receiv'd from Mr. Powis, as I was setting off for
    Town.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Mr. Powis to the Honourable GEORGE MOLESWORTH.</p>
    <p><i>London</i>,</p>
    <br />

    <p>"The first moment I can tear myself from the tender embraces of all my
    hopes;&mdash;the first moment I can leave my belov'd daughter, I come to
    Dover;&mdash;I come to acknowledge my gratitude to the noble-minded
    Molesworth&mdash;I come to testify my affection to the generous, disinterested Lord
    Darcey.&mdash;We pray for the recovery of his. Lordship's health.&mdash;When that is
    establish'd, not one wish will be wanting to complete the felicity of</p>

    <p>Darcey vows he will go to Town next week.&mdash;If fatigue should cause him to
    relapse, what will become of us <i>then?</i>&mdash;But I will not think of that
    <i>now</i>.</p>
    <p>We shall come down a joyful, cavalcade to the Abbey.&mdash;I long to see the doors

    <h2>LETTER XLI</h2>
    <p>The Honourable GEORGE MOLESWORTH to the same.</p>
    <p><i>London</i>.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Build in the park, and live batchelors!&mdash;Pish!&mdash;A horrid scheme!&mdash;I
    give it up.&mdash;Over head and ears, Dick!</p>
    <p>Last Monday arriv'd at his Lordship's house in <i>St. James's-Square</i>, the
    Right Honourable the Earl and Countess of Hampstead,&mdash;Lord Hallum,&mdash;the
    Ladies Elizabeth and Sophia Curtis.</p>
    <p><i>True</i>, as I hope to be sav'd;&mdash;and as <i>true</i>, that Lady Elizabeth
    and Sophia <i>are</i> blooming as angels.</p>
    <p>Three times have I sat down, <i>pen</i> in my hand, <i>paper</i> folded, yet could
    not tune my mind to write one word.&mdash;Over head and ears! I say.&mdash;</p>
    <br />

    <p>Past one in the morning!&mdash;All silent! Let me try if I can scribble now.</p>
    <p>First, I must tell you the body drove on shore at Dover, which I concluded was
    Miss Powis's, is discover'd to be a Miss Frances Walsh, going over in the yacht which
    was unfortunately cast-away;&mdash;the corpse much defac'd:&mdash;but what confirm'd
    it to be the body of Miss Powis, was a handkerchief taken from the neck mark'd F
    W.&mdash;Poor young Lady! her friends, perhaps are suffering the excesses of grief
    which <i>you</i> and I have so lately witness'd.&mdash;But <i>this</i> is a subject I
    shall not dwell on.</p>
    <p>I came to Town this evening with Darcey:&mdash;he bore the journey very
    poorly;&mdash;sinking, fainting, all the way.&mdash;When we got to our lodgings, and
    he was put into a bed, recovering a little, he press'd me to go to the
    Banker's.&mdash;I saw his impatience, and went immediately.</p>
    <p>My name was no sooner sent up, than Mr. Powis flew to receive me.&mdash;Welcome,
    my friend! said he; you come opportunely. We have a noble family with us that has
    been just wishing to see Mr. Molesworth.&mdash;He had time for no more; the door
    open'd.&mdash;What was my surprize to be embrac'd by Lord Hampstead and Lord Hallum,
    by them, led to the Countess and our two divinities, <i>whose</i> mild
    eyes,&mdash;<i>whose</i> elegant deportment, told me <i>Loves</i> and <i>Graces</i>
    had put a finishing stroke to the great work of <i>virtue</i> and
    <i>humility</i>.&mdash;Lady Mary Sutton,&mdash;yes, Lady Mary Sutton too was there:
    she advanc'd towards me, Miss Powis in her hand.</p>
    <p>I have the honour, said Mr. Powis, of presenting Lady Mary Sutton (the source of
    all my felicity) to Mr. Molesworth.&mdash;Then addressing himself to her Ladyship,
    Permit me, Madam, to introduce to you the friend I love.</p>
    <p>If ever I wish'd to shine, it was then&mdash;I would have given the world for
    eloquence;&mdash;nay, common understanding.&mdash;The former I <i>never</i>
    possessed:&mdash;A surprize and pleasure had flown away with the latter.&mdash;Miss
    Powis has that looks through one's very soul&mdash;a sweet compassionate eye: the
    dignity it expresses bespeaks your confidence.&mdash;She perceived my embarrassment,
    and said, Come, Mr. Molesworth, let me have the satisfaction of placing you next Lady
    Mary. So down sat the stupid blockhead.&mdash;Her Ladyship is very chatty, and very
    affable; she said a thousand obliging things; but half was lost upon me, whilst I
    watch'd the lips of my fair Elizabeth.</p>
    <p>Mr. Mrs. Powis, and Lady Mary, enquired affectionately after the health of Lord
    Darcey. When I said he was come to Town, up flew the heart's tell-tale to the face of
    Miss Powis.&mdash;Her father and mother ask'd, if they might have the happiness of
    waiting on his Lordship next morning.&mdash;I arose to assure them what joy their
    visit would occasion; when having settled the hour, and so forth, I slid to a chair
    vacant between Lady Elizabeth and Lady Sophia,&mdash;How enchanting <i>did</i> they
    look!&mdash;how enchanting <i>did</i> they speak!&mdash;No reserve;&mdash;all
    frankness;&mdash;the same innocence in their manners as at fifteen;&mdash;the
    vivacity of the French,&mdash;the sedateness of the English, how charmingly
    blended!</p>
    <p>Risby, thou art a fortunate fellow: Lady Sophia speaks of thee with esteem.</p>
    <p>The sweet syrens&mdash;<i>syrens</i> only by attraction&mdash;held me by the ear
    upwards of an hour.&mdash;From them I learnt Lady Mary Sutton came to England, on
    receiving an account from Mr. Delves that Miss Powis had the small-pox.&mdash;Happy
    for us, Dick, they lov'd Lady Mary too well to stay behind her!</p>
    <p>As I was listening to their entertaining descriptions of places abroad, we were
    join'd by Lord Hallum.&mdash;Molesworth, said his Lordship, I will not suffer these
    girls to engage you solely:&mdash;My prating sisters are grown so saucy that I am
    obliged to be a very tyrant.&mdash;</p>
    <p>A spirited conversation ensued, in which the cherub sisters bore away the
    palm.</p>
    <p>More and more sick of my batchelor notions!&mdash;Yet I aver, that state should be
    my choice, rather than swallow one grain of indifference in the matrimonial pill,
    gilder'd over ever so nicely.&mdash;Think what <i>must</i> be my friendship for
    Darcey, to tear myself from this engageing circle before nine!&mdash;As I was taking
    my leave, Lady Mary stepp'd towards me.&mdash;To-morrow, Mr. Molesworth, said her
    Ladyship, I bespeak the favour of your company and Lord Darcey's to dine with me in
    <i>Pall-Mall</i>:&mdash;I bow'd, and answer'd both for his Lordship and myself.</p>
    <p>We shall rejoice, continued she, to congratulate your friend on his
    recovery,&mdash;looking with peculiar meaning at Miss Powis.&mdash;I think by
    <i>that</i> look there will be an interview between the <i>lovers</i>, though I did
    not say so much to Darcey.&mdash;He requires sleep: none would he have had, if he
    knew my surmises.&mdash;I'll to bed, and dream of Lady Elizabeth;&mdash;<i>so</i>
    good night, Dick.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Twelve o'clock at noon.</p>
    <p>Mr. and Mrs. Powis this moment gone;&mdash;Lord Darcey dressing to meet them in
    <i>Pall-Mall</i>.&mdash;Yes, they are to be there;&mdash;and the whole groupe of
    beauties are to be there;&mdash;Miss Powis,&mdash;Lady Elizabeth,&mdash;Lady
    Sophia,&mdash;and the little sprightly hawk-eyed Delves.&mdash;Risby, <i>you</i> know
    nothing of <i>life</i>; you are <i>dead</i> and <i>buried</i>.</p>
    <p>I will try to be serious.&mdash;Impossible! my head runs round and round with
    pleasure.&mdash;The interview was affecting to the last degree.&mdash;Between
    whom?&mdash;Why Darcey, Mr. and Mrs.&mdash;faith I can write no more.</p>

    <h2>LETTER XLII.</h2>
    <p>The Hon. GEORGE MOLESWORTH to the same.</p>
    <p><i>London</i></p>
    <br />

    <p>The day of days is over!</p>
    <p>I am too happy to sleep:&mdash;exquisite felicity wants not the common supports of
    nature.&mdash;In such scenes as I have witness'd, the <i>soul</i> begins to know
    herself:&mdash;she gives us a peep into futurity:&mdash;the enjoyments of this day
    has been all her own.</p>
    <p>Once more I regain the beaten path of narrative.</p>
    <p>Suppose me then under the hands of hair-dressers, valets, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.
    I hate those fellows about me:&mdash;but the singularity of this visit made me
    undergo their tortures with tolerable patience.&mdash;Now was the time when Vanity,
    under pretence of respect, love, and decorum, usher'd in her implements.</p>
    <p>It was about two when we were set down at Lady Mary Sutton's.&mdash;Darcey
    trembled, and look'd so pale at coming out of his chair, that I desir'd a servant to
    shew us to a room, where we might be alone 'till Mr. Powis was inform'd of our being
    in the house.&mdash;He instantly came with Lady Mary.&mdash;Tender welcomes and
    affectionate caresses fill'd him with new life.&mdash;Her Ladyship propos'd he should
    first see Miss Powis in her dressing-room;&mdash;that none should be present but Mr.
    and Mrs. Powis, her Ladyship, and your humble servant.</p>
    <p>Judge how agreeable this must be to his Lordship, whose extreme weakness
    consider'd, could not have supported this interview before so much company as were
    assembled in the drawing-room.</p>
    <p>The plan settled, Lady Mary withdrew to prepare Miss Powis for our
    reception.&mdash;A footman soon came with a message from her Ladyship that she
    expected us.</p>
    <p>I was all compassionate at this moment:&mdash;the conflicts of my feeble friend
    were not to be conceal'd.&mdash;We follow'd Mr. Powis;&mdash;the door
    open'd;&mdash;Darcey turn'd half round, and laying his cold clammy hand on mine,
    said, Oh Molesworth! my happiness is in view!&mdash;how can I meet it?</p>
    <p>Inimitable creature!&mdash;Can I describe your reception of my friend?&mdash;can I
    describe the dignity of beauty;&mdash;the melting softness of sensibility;&mdash;the
    blushing emotion of surprize?&mdash;No, Risby;&mdash;impossible!</p>
    <p>The Ladies stood to receive us; Miss Powis supported between her mother and Lady
    Mary;&mdash;<i>she</i> all graceful timidity;&mdash;<i>they</i> all extasy and
    rapture.&mdash;Do you not expect to see Darcey at the feet of his mistress?&mdash;No;
    at Mrs. Powis's, at Lady Mary's, he fell.</p>
    <p>The eyes of his Adorable glisten'd.&mdash;He was rais'd, and embrac'd
    tenderly&mdash;by the parents,&mdash;by Lady Mary.&mdash;Mr. Powis said, presenting
    him to his delighted daughter, <i>You</i>, my dear, must make <i>our</i> returns of
    gratitude to Lord Darcey;&mdash;giving him her more than passive hand, which he
    press'd to his lips with fervor, saying, <i>This</i> is the hour my soul has flown up
    to petition&mdash;Dearest, best of women! tell me I am welcome.</p>
    <p>She attempted to reply;&mdash;it was only an attempt.</p>
    <p>She does bid you welcome, return'd Mr. Powis;&mdash;her <i>heart</i> bids you
    welcome.</p>
    <p>Indeed, said she, I am not ungrateful:&mdash;<i>indeed</i>, my Lord, I am not
    insensible to the obligations you have laid me under.</p>
    <p>As these words escap'd her, you must certainly take in the whole countenance of
    Darcey.</p>
    <p>By this time we were seated, and Lady Mary return'd to the company.</p>
    <p>Honour'd as I am, said his Lordship, addressing Miss Powis, will you permit me,
    Madam, in presence of your revered parents,&mdash;in presence of the friend to whom
    every wish of my heart has been confess'd;&mdash;will you permit me to hope you are
    not offended by my application to Sir James?&mdash;May I hope for your&mdash;</p>
    <p>Friendship, my Lord (reply'd she, interrupting him); you may command my
    friendship.</p>
    <p><i>Friendship!</i> (retorted he) Miss Powis, starting up:&mdash;is that <i>all
    I</i> am to expect?&mdash;Can I accept your <i>friendship?</i>&mdash;No, Madam, the
    man who would have died for you aspires to more than <i>friendship</i>;&mdash;he
    aspires to your <i>love</i>.</p>
    <p>I am no stranger, my Lord, return'd she, to the honour you intend me;&mdash;I am
    no stranger to <i>your</i> worth;&mdash;but I have scruples;&mdash;scruples that seem
    to me insurmountable.</p>
    <p>I never saw him so affected.</p>
    <p>For heaven's sake, Madam, he answer'd, don't drive me to despair:&mdash;tear not
    open the wound which the hand of Mercy has just clos'd:&mdash;my shatter'd frame will
    not bear another rub from fortune.&mdash;<i>What scruples?</i>&mdash;Tell me, Miss
    Powis, I conjure you.</p>
    <p>You have none, my dear child, said Mrs. Powis. You have none, Fanny, said Mr.
    Powis, but what his Lordship can remove.</p>
    <p>Indeed, Sir!&mdash;indeed, Madam! replied she, I meant not to give Lord Darcey
    pain.&mdash;Then turning to him in a tender, soothing accent,&mdash;Your peace, my
    Lord, has never been lightly regarded by me.&mdash;Here he brighten'd up,&mdash;and
    said, taking her hand, You know not, Miss Powis, from the first moment I saw you, how
    ardent,&mdash;how steady has been my love.</p>
    <p>Why <i>then</i> my Lord, resum'd she&mdash;<i>why</i> endeavour to gain my
    affections, yet hide your preference for me from the <i>world</i>;&mdash;even from
    <i>myself?</i>&mdash;Think of the <i>day</i> Lord Allen dined at the
    Abbey;&mdash;think what pass'd in a walk preceding <i>that</i> you set out for
    town:&mdash;on both these,&mdash;on many others, how mysterious your
    conduct?&mdash;If you thought me worthy your regard, my Lord, why <i>such</i>
    mysteries?</p>
    <p>For God's sake, my dear,&mdash;dear Miss Powis, said Darcey, suffer me to
    vindicate myself.&mdash;Pardon me, my Lord (continued the angel that harangued him)
    hear me patiently another moment, and I will listen to your vindication.</p>
    <p>She went on.</p>
    <p>From whence can I suppose, my Lord, your embarrassments proceeded, if not from
    <i>some</i> entanglement grown irksome?&mdash;No; before I can promise <i>myself</i>
    happiness, I must be first satisfied I do not borrow that <i>happiness</i> from
    <i>another</i>.</p>
    <p><i>Another</i>, Madam! repeated he, throwing himself at her feet:&mdash;May all my
    brighter prospects fly me;&mdash;may my youth be blighted by the loss of reason if I
    have ever lov'd <i>another!</i></p>
    <p>She was affected with the solemnity of his air: one pearly drop stray'd down her
    cheek;&mdash;one that escap'd the liquid body of tenderness assembled in her
    eyes:&mdash;she could not speak, but held out her snowy hand for him to be
    seated.</p>
    <p>He obey'd; and placing himself next her, so clearly accounted for that part of his
    conduct she call'd mysterious, that Mr. and Mrs. Powis both at once exclaim'd, Now,
    my dear, complete our felicity;&mdash;now all your <i>scruples must</i> be over.</p>
    <p>And do you, said she, my tender, my indulgent parents, rising and throwing herself
    into their arms;&mdash;do you say it is in <i>my</i> power to complete your
    felicity?&mdash;<i>Will</i> confessing a preference for Lord
    Darcey;&mdash;<i>will</i> declaring I wish you to prefer him to your
    daughter;&mdash;will <i>that</i> complete it?</p>
    <p>My friend caught the blushing beauty from the arms of her parents, and, frantic
    with joy, folded her to his bosom, standing as if he wonder'd at his own
    happiness.</p>
    <p>What innocence in the look of Miss Powis, when she greatly acknowledg'd her
    heart!&mdash;How reverse from <i>this</i> innocence, <i>this</i> greatness, is the
    <i>prudish hypocrite</i>, who forbids <i>even</i> her features to say she is
    susceptible of love! You may suppose a profusion of friendly acknowledgments fell to
    <i>my</i> share; but I am not vain enough to repeat them.</p>
    <p>It is well Lady Elizabeth stands portress at the door of my heart:&mdash;there is
    such bustling and pushing to get in;&mdash;but, notwithstanding her Ladyship's
    vigilance, Miss Powis has slipp'd by, and sits perch'd up in the same corner with
    Darcey.</p>
    <p>If you go back to Lady Mary's dressing-room, you will find nobody
    <i>there</i>:&mdash;but give a peep into the dining-parlour, and you will see us just
    set down at dinner;&mdash;<i>all</i> smiling,&mdash;<i>all</i> happy;&mdash;an
    inexhaustible fountain of pleasure in every breast.</p>
    <p>I will go down to Slope Hall;&mdash;give Lady Dorothy a hint that she has it now
    in her power to make one man happy;&mdash;<i>a hint</i> I believe she never had
    before.&mdash;A snug twenty thousand added to my present fortune,&mdash;the hand of
    Lady Elizabeth,&mdash;and then, Risby, get hold of my skirts, and you mount with
    me.</p>
    <p>Next Tuesday prepare, as governor of the castle, for a warm
    siege.&mdash;<i>Such</i> a battery of eyes,&mdash;<i>such</i> bundles of
    darts,&mdash;<i>such</i> stores of smiles,&mdash;<i>such</i> a train of innocence
    will be laid before the walls, as never was withstood!&mdash;No; I shall see you
    <i>cap-&agrave;-p&eacute;e</i> open the gates to the besiegers.&mdash;Away goes my
    pen.&mdash;I write no more positively.</p>

    <h2>LETTER XLIII.</h2>
    <p>Miss DELVES to Mrs. DELVES.</p>
    <p><i>Barford Abbey</i>.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Are you well, Madam? Is my dear father well? Tell me you are, and never was so
    happy a creature as your daughter. I tremble with pleasure,&mdash;with
    joy,&mdash;with delight:&mdash;but I <i>must</i>&mdash;my duty, my affection, every
    thing says I <i>must</i> sit down to write.&mdash;You did not see how we were
    marshall'd at setting out:&mdash;I wish you could have got up early
    enough:&mdash;never was there such joyous party!</p>
    <p>All in Lady Mary's dining-room by seven;&mdash;the fine equipages at the
    door;&mdash;servants attending in rich new liveries, to the number of
    twenty;&mdash;Lord Darcey and his heavenly bride that is to be,&mdash;smiling on each
    other,&mdash;smiling on all around;&mdash;Lady Mary Sutton&mdash;yes, <i>she</i> is
    heavenly <i>too</i>;&mdash;I believe I was the only earthly creature amongst
    them;&mdash;Lord and Lady Hampstead,&mdash;the angelic Ladies Elizabeth and
    Sophia,&mdash;Mr. Molesworth,&mdash;the generous, friendly, open-hearted Mr.
    Molesworth,&mdash;Lord Hallum.&mdash;But why mention him last?&mdash;Because, Bessy,
    I suppose he was <i>last</i> in your thoughts.&mdash;Dear Madam, how can you think
    so?</p>
    <p>In Lady Mary's coach went her Ladyship, Lord Darcey, Mrs. and Miss Powis:&mdash;in
    Lord Hampstead's, his Lordship, Lady Hampstead, Lady Elizabeth, and Mr.
    Molesworth:&mdash;in Lord Darcey's, Lady Sophia, Mr. Powis, Lord Hallum, and your
    little <i>good-for-nothing</i>:&mdash;in Mr. Powis's, the women-servants.&mdash;We
    lay fifty miles short of the Abbey, and the next evening reach'd it at seven.</p>
    <p>We reach'd Barford Abbey, I say&mdash;but what shall I say <i>now?</i>&mdash;I
    cannot do justice to what I have seen of duty,&mdash;of affection,&mdash;of
    joy,&mdash;of hospitality.&mdash;Do, dear Madam, persuade my father to purchase a
    house in <i>this</i> neighbourhood.</p>
    <p>Servants were posted at the distance of six miles to carry intelligence when we
    should approach.&mdash;I suppose in their way back it was proclaim'd in the
    village:&mdash;men, women, and children, lined the road a mile from the Abbey,
    throwing up their hats with loud huzzaing,&mdash;bells ringing in every adjacent
    parish;&mdash;bonfires on every rising ground;&mdash;in short, we were usher'd in
    like conquerors.&mdash;The coachmen whipp'd up their horses full speed through the
    park;&mdash;thump, thump, went my heart, when by a number of lights I discover'd we
    were just at the house.</p>
    <p>What sensations did I feel when the carriages stopp'd!&mdash;At the entrance stood
    Sir James and Lady Powis,&mdash;the Chaplain,&mdash;Mr. Morgan,&mdash;Captain
    Risby,&mdash;you know their characters, Madam;&mdash;every servant in the house with
    a light:&mdash;but who could have stay'd within at this juncture?</p>
    <p>The first coach that drove up was Lady Mary's. Out sprang Lord Darcey, Miss Powis
    in his hand; both in a moment lock'd in parental embraces.&mdash;Good heaven, what
    extasy!&mdash;I thought Mr. Watson and Mr. Morgan would have fought a duel which
    should first have folded Miss Powis in his arms, whilst Sir James and Lady Powis
    quitted her to welcome Lady Mary.&mdash;We were all receiv'd tenderly
    affectionate:&mdash;a reception none can have an idea of, but those who have been at
    Barford Abbey.</p>
    <p>In my way to the house, I suppose I had a hundred kisses:&mdash;<i>God knows from
    whom</i>.&mdash;What can I say of Lord Hampstead's family?&mdash;what of Mr.
    Molesworth?&mdash;The general notice taken of him is sufficient.&mdash;Absolutely
    that charming man will be spoil'd.&mdash;Pity to set him up for an idol!&mdash;I hope
    he will not <i>always</i> expect to be worshipp'd&mdash;Mr. Risby
    <i>too</i>&mdash;Well, I'll mention you all, one after another, as fast as
    possible.&mdash;Let me see, where did I leave off?&mdash;Oh! we were just out of our
    carriages.&mdash;And now for the pathetics:&mdash;an attempt;&mdash;a humble attempt
    only.</p>
    <p>Lady Powis, Lady Mary, and their darling, had given us the slip.&mdash;What could
    be done?&mdash;I mean with Mr. Morgan:&mdash;he was quite outrageous.&mdash;What
    could be done? I repeat.&mdash;Why Sir James, to pacify him, said, we should all go
    and surprize them in his Lady's dressing-room.&mdash;We did go;&mdash;we did surprize
    them;&mdash;great God! in what an attitude!&mdash;The exalted Lady Powis at the feet
    of Lady Mary;&mdash;Miss Powis kneeling by her;&mdash;she endeavouring to raise
    them.&mdash;I said it would be an attempt at the pathetics;&mdash;it must be an
    attempt:&mdash;I can proceed no farther.</p>
    <p>To be sure, Mr. Morgan is a queer-looking man, but a great favourite at the
    Abbey.&mdash;He took Miss Powis on his knee;&mdash;call'd her a hundred times his
    dear, dear daughter;&mdash;and I could not forbear laughing, when he told her he had
    not wore a tye-wig before these twenty years. This drew me to observe his dress,
    which, unless you knew the man, you can have no idea how well it suited him:&mdash;a
    dark snuff-colour'd coat with gold buttons, which I suppose by the fashion of it, was
    made when he accustomed himself to <i>tye-wigs</i>;&mdash;the lace a rich orrice; but
    then it was so immoderately short, both in the sleeves and skirts, that whilst full
    dress'd he appeared to want cloathing.</p>
    <p>The <i>next</i> morning,&mdash;ay, the <i>next</i> morning, then it was I lost my
    freedom.&mdash;Disrob'd of his gingerbread coat, I absolutely sell a sacrifice to a
    plain suit of broad cloth,&mdash;or rather, to a noble, plain heart.&mdash;Now pray,
    dear Madam, do not cross me in my <i>first</i> love;&mdash;at least, <i>see</i> Mr.
    Morgan, before you command me to give him up:&mdash;and you, sweet Sir, steal to a
    corner of your new possession, whilst I take notice of those who are capering to my
    fingers ends.</p>
    <p>You have seen Miss Powis, Madam, on Mr. Morgan's knee;&mdash;you have heard him
    say enough to fill any other girl than myself with jealousy:&mdash;nay, Madam, you
    may smile;&mdash;he really makes love to me.&mdash;But for a moment let me forget my
    lover;&mdash;let me forget his <i>melting</i> sighs,&mdash;his <i>tender</i>
    protections,&mdash;his <i>persuasive</i> eloquence,&mdash;his air <i>so</i>
    languishing:&mdash;let me forget them <i>all</i>, I say, and lead you to the library,
    where by a message flew Miss Powis.&mdash;A look from her drew me after:&mdash;I
    suppose Lord Darcey had a touch from the same magnet.</p>
    <p>A venerable pair with joy next to phrenzy caught her in their extended arms, as
    the door open'd. My <i>kind</i>, my dear, <i>ever</i> dear friends, said the lovely
    creature,&mdash;and is it <i>thus</i> we meet? is it <i>thus</i> I return to
    you?&mdash;Mr. Jenkings clasp'd her to him; but his utterance was quite
    choak'd:&mdash;the old Lady burst into a flood of tears, and then cried
    out,&mdash;How great is thy mercy, O God!&mdash;Suffer me to be grateful.&mdash;Again
    she flew to their arms;&mdash;again they folded her to their bosoms.&mdash;Lord
    Darcey too embrac'd them;&mdash;he condescendingly kiss'd their hands;&mdash;he said,
    next to the parents of his Fanny,&mdash;next to Lady Mary, they were most dear to
    him.&mdash;Miss Powis seated herself between them, and hung about the neck of Mrs.
    Jenkings;&mdash;whilst his Lordship, full of admiration, look'd as if his great soul
    labour'd for expression.&mdash;</p>
    <p>Overcome with tender scenes, I left the library.&mdash;I acquainted Lady Mary who
    was there, and she went to them immediately.&mdash;Mr. Watson and Mr. Morgan for a
    quarter of an hour were all my own;&mdash;captain Risby, Mr. Molesworth, Lady
    Elizabeth and Sophia, being engag'd in a conversation at another part of the
    room:&mdash;you may <i>guess</i> our subject, Madam;&mdash;but I declare, whilst
    listening to Mr. Watson, I thought myself soaring above earthly
    enjoyments.&mdash;</p>
    <p>Sir James, who had follow'd Lady Mary, soon return'd with her Ladyship, Miss
    Powis, Lord Darcey, and, what gave me heart-felt pleasure, the steward and his
    wife;&mdash;an honour they with difficulty accepted, as they were strangers to Lord
    Hampstead's family.&mdash;</p>
    <p>Who says there is not in this life perfect happiness?&mdash;I say they are
    mistaken:&mdash;such felicity as I here see and partake of, cannot be call'd
    imperfect&mdash;How comes it that the domestics of <i>this</i> family <i>so</i> much
    surpass those of <i>other</i> people?&mdash;how is it <i>one</i> interest governs the
    whole?&mdash;I want to know a thousand mysteries.&mdash;I could write,&mdash;I could
    think eternally,&mdash;of the first happy evening.&mdash;First happy evening do I
    say? And can the days that crown that eve be forgot?&mdash;Heaven forbid! at least
    whilst I have recollection.&mdash;My heart speaks so fast to my pen, that fain my
    fingers would,&mdash;but cannot keep up with it.</p>
    <p>The next morning Lord Darcey introduc'd to us the son of Mr. Jenkings.&mdash;A
    finer youth I never saw!&mdash;Well might the old gentleman be
    <i>suspicious</i>.&mdash;Few fathers would, like <i>him</i>, have sacrificed the
    interest of a son, to preserve that of a friend.&mdash;To know the real rank of Miss
    Powis;&mdash;her ten thousand virtues;&mdash;her great expectations; yet act with so
    <i>much</i> caution!&mdash;with an anxiety which the most sordid miser watching his
    treasure, could not have exceeded! and for <i>what?</i>&mdash;Why lest involuntarily
    she might enrich his belov'd son with <i>her</i> affections.&mdash;Will you part with
    me to this extraordinary man?&mdash;Only for an hour or two.&mdash;A walk is
    propos'd.&mdash;Our ramble will not be farther than his house.&mdash;You say I may
    go. Thank you, Madam: I am gone.</p>
    <p>Just return'd from the steward's, so cramm'd with sweet-meats, cake, and jellies,
    that I am absolutely stupified.</p>
    <p>I must tell you who led Miss Powis.&mdash;Lord Darcey, to be sure.&mdash;No,
    Madam; I had the favour of his Lordship's arm:&mdash;it was Edmund.&mdash;I call him
    Edmund;&mdash;every body calls him Edmund;&mdash;<i>yes</i>, and at Lord Darcey's
    request <i>too</i>.&mdash;Never shall I forget in what a graceful manner!&mdash;But
    his Lordship does every thing with grace.&mdash;He mention'd something of past times,
    hinting he should not always have courted him to <i>such</i> honour, presenting the
    hand of his belov'd.</p>
    <p>I wish I could send you her look at that moment; it was all love,&mdash;all
    condescension.&mdash;I say I cannot send it.&mdash;Mortifying! I cannot even borrow
    <i>it</i>.</p>
    <p>Adieu, dear Madam!&mdash;Adieu, dear Sir!&mdash;Adieu, you best of
    parents&mdash;It is impossible to say which is most dear to your ever dutiful and
    affectionate</p>

    <p>Miss DELVES to the same.</p>
    <p><i>Barford Abbey</i>.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Lost my heart <i>again!</i>&mdash;Be not surpriz'd, Madam; I lose and find it ten
    times a day;&mdash;yet it never strays from Barford Abbey.&mdash;The last account you
    had from me it was button'd inside Mr. Morgan's hunting-frock:&mdash;since that, it
    has been God knows with whom:&mdash;sometimes wrapt in a red coat;&mdash;sometimes in
    a blue;&mdash;sometimes in a green:&mdash;but finding many competitors flew to black,
    where it now lies snug, warm, and easy.&mdash;Restless creature! I will never take it
    home again.</p>
    <p>What think you, Madam, of a <i>Dean</i> for a son-in-law?</p>
    <p>What do I think? you say.&mdash;Why the gentlemen of the church have too much
    sense and gravity to take my madcap off my hands.&mdash;Well, Madam, but suppose the
    Dean of H&mdash;&mdash; now you look pleas'd.&mdash;Oh, the Dean of
    <i>H&mdash;&mdash;!</i> What the <i>Dean</i>, Bessy, that Lady Mary used to talk
    of:&mdash;the <i>Dean</i> that married Mr. and Mrs. Powis.</p>
    <p>As sure as I live, Madam, the <i>very</i> man:&mdash;and
    <i>to-morrow,&mdash;to-morrow at ten</i>, he is to unite their lovely daughter with
    Lord Darcey.&mdash;Am I not <i>very</i> good,&mdash;<i>extremely</i> good,
    <i>indeed</i>, to sit down and write,&mdash;when every person below is solacing
    themselves on the approach of this happy festival?</p>
    <p>I would suffer shipwreck ten times;&mdash;ten times would I be drove on
    uninhabited islands, for such a husband as Lord Darcey.&mdash;Miss Powis's danger was
    only imaginary, yet <i>she</i> must be <i>so</i> rewarded.&mdash;Well, she
    <i>shall</i> be rewarded:&mdash;she <i>ought</i> to be rewarded:&mdash;Lord Darcey
    shall reward her.</p>
    <p>But is it not <i>very</i> hard upon your <i>poor</i> girl, that <i>all</i> the
    young smarts we brought down, and <i>that</i> which we found <i>here</i>, should have
    dispos'd of their hearts?&mdash;<i>All</i>;&mdash;even Lord Hallum,&mdash;<i>he</i>
    who used to boast so much of freedom,&mdash;now owns he has dispos'd of
    his.&mdash;</p>
    <p>But to whom?&mdash;Aye: that's a question.&mdash;</p>
    <p>They think, perhaps, the <i>old</i> stuff will do well enough for poor
    me!&mdash;Thanks to my genius, I can set my cap at any thing.</p>
    <p>Why there's something tolerable in the sound of a Dean's Lady&mdash;Let me see if
    it will do.&mdash;"The <i>Deans's</i> coach;&mdash;the <i>Dean's</i>
    servants."&mdash;Something better this than a plain <i>Mr.</i></p>
    <p>Here comes Miss Powis. Now shall I be forc'd to huddle this into my
    pocket.&mdash;I am resolv'd she shall not see the preferment I have chalk'd out for
    myself.&mdash;No, no; I must be secret, or I shall have it taken from me.</p>
    <p><i>This</i> Miss Powis,&mdash;<i>this</i> very dutiful young Lady, that I used to
    have set up for a pattern,&mdash;<i>now</i> tells me that I <i>must</i> write no
    more; <i>that</i> you will not expect to hear from me 'till the next post.&mdash;If I
    <i>must</i> take Miss Powis's advice in everything;&mdash;if I <i>must</i> be guided
    by <i>her</i>;&mdash;you know <i>who</i> said this, Madam;&mdash;why then there is an
    end of my scribbling for this night.&mdash;But remember it is not <i>my</i>
    fault.&mdash;No, indeed, I was sat down as sober sedate as could be.&mdash;Quite fit
    for a Dean's Lady?&mdash;Yes;&mdash;quite fit, indeed.&mdash;Now comes Lady Elizabeth
    and Lady Sophia.&mdash;Well, it is impossible, I find, to be dutiful in this
    house.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Thursday, twelve o'clock at noon.</p>
    <p>Bless my soul! one would think I was the bride by my shaking and quaking! Miss
    Powis is&mdash;Lady Darcey.&mdash;Down drops my letter:&mdash;Yes, dear Madam, I see
    you drop it to run and tell my father.</p>
    <p>I may write on <i>now</i>;&mdash;I may do what I will;&mdash;Lord and Lady Darcey
    are <i>every</i> thing with <i>every</i> body Well as I love them, I was not present
    at the ceremony:&mdash;I don't know why neither.&mdash;Not a soul but attended,
    except your poor foolish girl&mdash;At the window I stood to see them go, and never
    stirr'd a step 'till they return'd.&mdash;Mr. Molesworth gave her away.&mdash;I vow I
    thought near as handsome as the bridegroom.&mdash;But what signifies my thinking him
    handsome?&mdash;I'll ask Lady Elizabeth by and bye what she thinks.&mdash;Now for a
    little about it, before I ature myself with implements of destruction.&mdash;The Dean
    is not quite dead yet; but if he live out this day,&mdash;I say, he is
    invulnerable.</p>
    <p>Let us hear no more of yourself:&mdash;tell us of Lord and Lady Darcey</p>
    <p>Have patience, Madam, and I will,</p>
    <p>Well, <i>their</i> dress?&mdash;Why <i>their</i> faces were dress'd in smiles of
    love:&mdash;Nature's charms should always take place of art.&mdash;You see with what
    order I proceed.</p>
    <p>Lord Darcey was dress'd in white richly lac'd with gold;&mdash;Lady Darcey in a
    white lutestring n&eacute;glig&eacute;e nounc'd deep with a silver net;&mdash;no cap,
    a diamond sprig; her hair without powder; a diamond necklace and
    sleeve-knots;&mdash;bracelets set round with diamonds; and let me tell you, her
    jewels are a present from my first Adorable;&mdash;on the knowledge of which I
    discarded him.&mdash;No, no, Mr. Morgan; you are not a <i>jewel</i> of yourself
    neither.&mdash;Lady Darcey would have wore quite a morning dishabille, if the vain
    old Gentleman had not requested the contrary:&mdash;so forsooth, to humour him, we
    must be all put out of our way.</p>
    <p>There they are on the lawn, as I hope to live, going to invite in
    Caesar.&mdash;Only an old dog, Madam, that lives betwixt this house and the
    steward's.</p>
    <p>Lady Elizabeth and Mr. Molesworth, Lady Sophia and Captain Risby,&mdash;Oh, I long
    to be with you!&mdash;throw no more gravel to my window.&mdash;I <i>will</i> be
    dutiful;&mdash;in spite of your allurements, I <i>will</i>.</p>
    <p>I left them in the library, inspecting a very charming piece, just brought from
    Brandon Lodge, done by the hand of Lady Mary Sutton.&mdash;Upon my word, they have
    soon conn'd it over:&mdash;but I have not told you it is the portraits of Mr. and
    Mrs. Powis;&mdash;my dear Dean too joining their hands.&mdash;</p>
    <p>God defend me! there he is, hopping out.&mdash;I wish he had kept
    within.&mdash;Why, Sir, I should have been down in a moment: then we might have had
    the most comfortable t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te.</p>
    <p>Seriously, Madam&mdash;now I am <i>really</i> serious&mdash;can you believe, after
    beholding Lord and Lady Darcey, I will ever be content with a moderate share of
    happiness?&mdash;No, I will die first.&mdash;To see them at this instant would be an
    antidote for indifference.&mdash;Not any thing of foolish fondness:&mdash;no; that
    will never be seen in Lord and Lady Darcey.&mdash;Their happiness is not
    confin'd:&mdash;we are all refreshed by it:&mdash;it pours forth from their homes
    like streams flowing from a pure terrain.&mdash;I think I said I could not go to
    church:&mdash;no, not for the world would I have gone:&mdash;I expected Miss Powis
    would be crying, fainting, and I know not what.&mdash;Instead of all this fuss, not a
    tear was shed.&mdash;I thought every body cried when they were married:&mdash;those
    that <i>had</i>, or had <i>not</i> cause.&mdash;Well, I am determin'd to appear
    satisfied, however, if the yoke is a little galling.</p>
    <p>How charming look'd Miss Powis, when she smil'd on Lord Darcey!&mdash;On Lord
    Darcey? On every body I mean.&mdash;And for him&mdash;But I must forget his
    air,&mdash;his words,&mdash;his looks, if ever I intend to say love, honour, and
    obey.&mdash;Once I am brought to say love,&mdash;honour and obey will slide off
    glibly enough. I must go down amongst them. Believe me, Madam, I shut myself up to
    write against intreaties,&mdash;against the most persuasive eloquence.</p>
    <p>This is the day when the Powis family are crown'd with felicity.&mdash;I think on
    it with rapture.&mdash;I will set it down on the heart of your dutiful and
    affectionate</p>

    <p>Miss Delves to the same.</p>
    <p><i>Barford Abbey</i></p>
    <br />

    <p>Surely I must smell of venison,&mdash;roast beef, and plumb-puddings.&mdash;Yes, I
    smell of the Old English hospitality.&mdash;<i>You</i>, Madam, have no tenants to
    regale so;&mdash;are safe from such troubles on my account.&mdash;Will you believe
    me, Madam, I had rather see their honest old faces than go to the finest opera ever
    exhibited.&mdash;What think you of a hundred-and-seven chearful farmers sitting at
    long tables spread with every thing the season can afford;&mdash;two hogsheads of
    wine at their elbows;&mdash;the servants waiting on them with assiduous
    respect:&mdash;Their songs still echo in my ears.</p>
    <p>I thought the roof would have come down, when Lord and Lady Darcey made their
    appearance.&mdash;Some sung one tune,&mdash;some another;&mdash;some paid extempore
    congratulations;&mdash;others that had not a genius, made use of ballads compos'd on
    the marriage of the King and Queen.&mdash;One poor old soul cried to the Butler,
    because he could neither sing or repeat a verse.&mdash;Seeing his distress, I went to
    him, and repeated a few lines applicable to the occasion, which he caught in a
    moment, and tun'd away with the best of them.</p>
    <p>Lord and Lady Hampstead are so delighted with the honest rustics, that they
    declare every Christmas their tenants shall be regal'd at Hallum Grove.</p>
    <p>What can one feel equal to the satisfaction which arises on looking out in the
    park?&mdash;Three hundred poor are there feasting under a shed erected for the
    purpose;&mdash;cloath'd by Sir James and Lady Powis;&mdash;<i>so</i>
    clean,&mdash;<i>so</i> warm,&mdash;<i>so</i> comfortable, that to see them at this
    moment, one would suppose they had never tasted of poverty.</p>
    <p>Lord Darcey has order'd two hundred guineas to be given amongst them,&mdash;that
    to-morrow might not be less welcome to them than this day.</p>
    <p>For my part, I have only two to provide for out of the number;&mdash;a pretty
    little boy and girl, that pick'd me up before I came to the shed.&mdash;The parents
    of those children were very good, and gave them to me on my first application.</p>
    <p>Here comes Mrs. Jenkings.&mdash;<i>Well</i>, what pleasing thing have you to tell
    me, Mrs. Jenkings?</p>
    <p>Five hundred pounds, as I live, to be given to the poor to-morrow from Lady Mary
    Sutton.&mdash;</p>
    <p>What blessings will follow us on our journey! I believe I have not told you,
    Madam, we set out for Faulcum Park on Monday.&mdash;<i>Not</i> to stay:&mdash;no, I
    thank God we are <i>not</i> to stay.&mdash;If Lord and Lady Darcey were to inhabit
    Faulcum Park, yet it would not be to <i>me</i> like Barford Abbey,&mdash;Barford
    Abbey is to be their home whilst Sir James and Lady Powis live.</p>
    <p>Lord Hallum wants me to walk with him.&mdash;Not I, indeed:&mdash;I hate a
    <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> with heartless men.&mdash;On second thoughts, I
    will go.</p>
    <p>Oh Madam! out of breath with astonishment!&mdash;What think you:&mdash;I am the
    confidante of Lord Hallum's passion;&mdash;with permission too of the earl and

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
